## When to write a new ADR

Write a new ADR whenever:

- A previously documented decision changes — even partially. Mark the old ADR `Status: Superseded by ADR-NNN` and add a new ADR explaining what changed and why.
- A decision is deprecated (we no longer want to do it this way, but no replacement exists yet). Set the old ADR's `Status: Deprecated` and explain in the body.
- The scope of an existing decision expands enough that the rationale no longer fits the original "Context" section.
- A new constraint or trade-off appears that the original ADR didn't consider.

A dated amendment to the owning ADR is permitted when the maintainer explicitly
requests it and the original decision and rationale remain intact below the
amendment. Use amendments for bounded reversals of the mechanism that ADR owns;
use a new ADR when responsibility, architecture, or rationale moves elsewhere.

Don't write a new ADR for: typo fixes, prose tightening of an existing ADR, or expanding a verification block in place. Edit the existing file.

Supersession discipline:

- The new ADR's `Status` line reads `Accepted` (or `Proposed` initially) and includes a `Supersedes ADR-XXX` reference somewhere in the body (typically in Context or References).
- The old ADR's `Status` line is updated to `Superseded by ADR-NNN` in the **same PR**. Never leave the supersession dangling in a follow-up.
