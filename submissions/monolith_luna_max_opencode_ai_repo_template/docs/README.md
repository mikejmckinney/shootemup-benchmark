# Documentation Directory

> **Purpose**: Human-readable reference documentation, specifications, and research materials.

## Priority Note for AI Agents

This directory contains **supporting documentation**. When sources conflict,
see `AGENTS.md` §"Truth hierarchy" for the canonical order (summary: current
issue/PR > `AGENTS.md` > `.context/**` > `docs/**` > codebase).

## What Belongs Here

### `reference/`

- Original project specifications
- Research notes
- External API documentation
- Competitor analysis
- Historical context

### `research/`

- Research output (needs analysis, competitive landscape, impact scores)
- Problem validation artifacts
- Stakeholder feedback summaries
- Market research findings

### `guides/`

- Development setup instructions
- Deployment procedures
- Troubleshooting guides
- Contribution guidelines

### `benchmarks/`

- Published benchmark results used for repository decisions
- Immutable source, run, commit, and artifact references
- No harnesses, raw responses, worktrees, or unsealed candidate mappings

### `decisions/`

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Design rationale
- Trade-off analysis

### `postmortems/`

- Retrospective lessons learned (incidents, surprises, friction)
- Paired with ADRs: ADRs are prospective, postmortems are retrospective
- See `postmortems/README.md` for the "What generalizes" promotion gate

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Current task state → use the assigned GitHub issue/PR and latest
  `agent-state:v1` comment; `.context/state/` documents the reference format
- Project roadmap → use `.context/roadmap.md`
- Repository-wide operating policy → use `AGENTS.md`
- Design mockups → use `.context/vision/`

## Creating an ADR

Use this template for architecture decisions:

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Title

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX

## Context
What is the issue we're facing?

## Decision
What have we decided to do?

## Consequences
What are the positive and negative consequences?
```
