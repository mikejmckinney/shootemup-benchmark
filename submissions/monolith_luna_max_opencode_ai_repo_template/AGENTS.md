# AGENTS.md

<!-- AGENTS_MD_VERSION: 39 -->

## Truth hierarchy

When sources conflict, use this order:

1. Current assigned issue and linked PR for task scope and acceptance criteria.
2. `AGENTS.md` for repository-wide operating policy.
3. `.context/**` for current project direction and state guidance.
4. `docs/**` for durable decisions, guides, and historical rationale.
5. The codebase for implementation reality.

Current files and live GitHub state outrank historical transcripts and archived
session notes.

## Repository entry gate

Before taking repository action in an unfamiliar repository, load and run the
`repo-onboarding` skill. A repository is unfamiliar when the current
conversation has neither a successful onboarding receipt for that repository
nor recovered context containing a still-applicable receipt.

Do not rerun onboarding during the same continuous session after a successful
receipt. For resumed or post-compaction work with an exact session ID, run
`session-recovery` first. Recovery takes precedence; run `repo-onboarding`
afterward only when recovery does not establish current repository orientation.

Onboarding is evidence gathering, not authorization for destructive changes.
The `template-seed` mode still requires explicit approval before repository
edits, while retained template resources may be extended or replaced only when
current project evidence requires it.

## Execution model

- Use one monolithic implementing agent. ADR-031 found no favorable ROI crossover
  for the multi-role pipeline and retired the role registry.
- Use the `multi-model-consensus` skill only when the user requests it or consequential
  uncertainty justifies independent multi-model review.
- Advisory review normally runs in parallel with active PR implementation and
  remains non-blocking. CI and lint remain the blocking pre-merge controls.

## Parallel advisory review

For every eligible same-repository task PR that an agent creates or claims,
apply `ai-review:live` immediately after opening the draft PR or when work begins
on an existing PR. Continue implementation, testing, and checkpoint pushes
without waiting for advisory review.

Before declaring implementation complete, inspect any advisory snapshot that
has already arrived. Compare its `Head` SHA with the current PR head, treat a
mismatch as stale evidence, and independently verify each applicable finding.
Fix only verified, in-scope defects that affect issue acceptance criteria, the
user outcome, a hard rule, security, data safety, or blocking CI. Record other
findings as deferred or rejected with concise reasoning. A `defer` band or
trivial fix cost is not, by itself, authorization to expand scope or modify code.

Missing, stale, running, or failed advisory feedback is never a merge gate and
does not justify waiting. Record the state and continue under the normal CI,
lint, sandbox, user-outcome, and maintainer controls. Exempt fork PRs,
`smoke-test` PRs, and repositories where the workflow, label, required provider
credentials, or label-write permission are unavailable; record the exemption.

## Domain: Code Quality

### Hard Rules (Never Violate)

#### H1 — Single Responsibility

Every function, class, and module has **one reason to change**. If you can describe a unit with "and" ("parses input **and** writes to the database"), split it. Flag any unit where two unrelated reasons to change live in the same file.

#### H2 — Open / Closed

Extend behavior by adding new code, not by mutating stable interfaces. Any breaking change to a published interface, exported type, or public API requires an ADR plus a migration note for downstream callers.

#### H3 — Liskov Substitution

Subtypes must honor their base contract. Do not narrow preconditions or widen postconditions in an override. If a subtype can't honor the contract, it's not a subtype — compose instead of inherit.

#### H4 — Interface Segregation

Callers must not be forced to depend on methods they don't use. Split fat interfaces into role-specific ones. "One method per caller concern" is the floor, not the ceiling.

#### H5 — Dependency Inversion

High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete low-level modules. Inject dependencies; don't `new` them inside business logic. Concrete wiring lives at the composition root (main / entry point).

#### H6 — TDD Discipline

Write a failing test **before** implementation. Keep the red-green-refactor loop explicit. See `AGENTS.md` → "Testing requirements" for the test pyramid and CI expectations — this file does not duplicate them.

#### H7 — No Dead Code

Unreachable branches, unused exports, commented-out blocks, and speculative helpers ship zero value. Delete them before merge. If you think you'll need something "soon," open a task instead of leaving a stub.

#### H8 — No Silent Error Swallowing

Every `catch` / `rescue` / `recover` block must either rethrow with context, log with enough detail to diagnose, or convert to a handled result that the caller can act on. Empty catch blocks and bare `except: pass` fail diff-gate.

### Soft Rules (Prefer Unless Justified)

#### S1 — Function Length

Target: a function fits on one screen without scrolling. Add a numeric threshold
only when the project has an actual stack-specific lint or review contract.
Rationale matters more than the count: if a longer function is genuinely more
readable than its split form, keep it and say why in a comment.

#### S2 — Complexity and Nesting

Target: cyclomatic complexity and nesting depth stay low enough that a reader can hold the control flow in their head. When you feel yourself indenting a fourth level, extract.

#### S3 — Names Describe Intent

Names say **what the code is for**, not **how it works**. Prefer `calculateRenewalDate` over `addThirtyDays`. Avoid abbreviations unless the abbreviation is a term of art in your domain — and if it is, capture it in a glossary.

#### S4 — Comments Explain Why

Comments say **why**, not **what**. If the code already says what it does, a comment that restates it is noise — delete it. Use comments to record non-obvious tradeoffs, links to issues, and decisions the reader can't reconstruct from the code.

#### S5 — Duplication Beats the Wrong Abstraction

Two similar blocks are cheaper than a premature abstraction. Three is a signal to extract — but only if the three genuinely share a reason to change (see H1). Rushing to DRY fuses code that should diverge.

#### S6 — Test Pyramid

Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E tests. Concrete CI commands and coverage expectations live in `AGENTS.md` → "Testing requirements" and the project's own `README.md`.

## Clarification and ambiguity

When a request is ambiguous — where different reasonable interpretations lead to meaningfully different work — stop, ask, recommend and explain reasoning before proceeding. Don't guess and build, and don't ask and build in parallel; ask, then wait.

- **Always Verify details with live sources when available and cite sources**
- **When to trigger a clarifying question.** Ask specifically when: (1) the request could reasonably mean two or more different things, (2) a decision requires information only the user has (business context, preferences, external constraints), (3) the request conflicts with something in the repo's rules or prior decisions (follow the **Push back** rule in [Critical thinking and communication](#critical-thinking-and-communication) rather than just asking), or (4) proceeding would require inventing facts (API shapes, data structures, domain terms) that can't be verified.

For unexpected issues that are difficult to resolve like a process that consistently hangs or fails despite multiple attempts to fix it, research the issue on the internet to see if it is a known issue others have encountered and what the fix or workaround is.

## Problem framing

Validate the **what** and **why** before designing the **how** when work involves
net-new behavior, ambiguous scope, a user-facing product choice, or a costly or
difficult-to-reverse decision.

Before implementation planning, establish:

- **Affected actor:** who experiences the problem and what job they are trying
  to complete.
- **Problem:** the observable pain, limitation, or unmet need.
- **Why it matters:** impact supported by repository evidence, user evidence, or
  cited external sources.
- **User outcome:** what the affected actor will be able to do when the work
  succeeds. State this in do-language, not as files or deliverables.
- **Use cases:** the realistic workflows that must succeed.
- **Evidence:** verified facts, relevant sources, and explicitly uncertain
  claims.
- **Load-bearing assumptions:** what must be true for the proposed direction to
  solve the problem.
- **Alternatives:** existing repository behavior or external solutions that
  could satisfy the outcome with less cost or risk.
- **Delivery boundaries:** identify independently shippable and revertible
  workstreams. For each, state dependencies, shared contracts, and rollback
  effect; recommend one PR, stacked PRs, or separate PRs. If independently
  revertible work remains combined, record the load-bearing reason, such as
  atomic rollout, a shared contract, lower total process cost, or an explicit
  maintainer decision.

If missing information could materially change scope or the user outcome, stop,
ask a focused question, recommend a direction, and explain the tradeoff. If the
outcome is directly inferable from verified evidence, state it and proceed
without adding a mandatory approval pause.

This deeper framing is normally unnecessary for deterministic bug fixes,
dependency updates, reverts, behavior-neutral refactors, and documentation with
no operational behavior. The exemption does not apply when the reported bug,
documentation procedure, or expected behavior is itself ambiguous.

For product or market decisions, use
[`docs/guides/problem-framing.md`](docs/guides/problem-framing.md) for conditional
audience, alternative, competitive, and impact analysis. Do not require market
analysis for routine repository implementation.

## Critical thinking and communication

Agents must reason critically rather than agree by default. The bar is "objective and evidence-based," not "agreeable."

- **Push back when warranted.** If the user's plan, premise, or proposed code has a flaw, say so directly and explain why. Don't hedge to be polite. If a better approach exists, recommend it and justify the tradeoff.
- **Calibrate confidence.** State what you verified vs. what you assumed. When something is uncertain, say "uncertain" — don't pad with false confidence and don't hide behind vague qualifiers.
- **Don't guess APIs, file contents, or runtime behavior.** Verify by reading the file or searching the codebase. If you can't verify, say so explicitly rather than asserting.
- **Compare approaches honestly.** When multiple options are viable, name the tradeoffs (cost, risk, reversibility, blast radius) before recommending one.
- **Cite your sources.** When stating a fact about the codebase or docs, include a relative path (and a line number when precision matters: `path/to/file.md:42`). Statements without a citation are treated as assumptions and must be marked `uncertain`.
- **Surface load-bearing assumptions.** State what the recommendation depends on, how each assumption was verified, and what changes if it is false.
- **Use evidence instead of evaluative adjectives.** Words such as "comprehensive," "seamless," "robust," and "enterprise-grade" are not evidence. Replace them with observable behavior, constraints, or measured results.
- **Separate facts from estimates.** Audience reach, market size, impact, and feasibility estimates must identify their source, confidence, and uncertainty. Do not present arithmetic precision as validated evidence.
- **Always Explain your reasoning and Default to concise.** Add structure only when it earns its keep; don't pad length or drop detail the answer needs. If a complete answer genuinely requires length, use multiple parts or multiple responses rather than cutting corners.

## Opportunity feedback channel

### Purpose

Adjacent improvements (brittle script, stale doc, automation gap) historically caused scope creep or got dropped. The `opportunity_notes` channel gives agents a capped, evaluable triage queue.

### When this rule fires

- Out-of-scope observation during in-scope work.
- Recommendation benefiting future sessions but not needed now.
- Duplicate, contradictory, or stale convention noticed while reading.

### What counts as an opportunity note

- Outside current task scope but inside repo improvement surface.
- Deferrable — current task can complete without it.
- Concrete — names a file, behavior, or symptom.
- NOT urgent for correctness, security, or in-flight work (use escalation below).

### Required fields (8 total)

Empty list permitted; partially-filled entries are not.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | One-line headline. ≤80 chars. |
| `evidence` | string | What you observed. File path, command output, or behavior. |
| `impact` | string | Who/what is affected and how. |
| `recommendation` | string | Concrete enough to file. |
| `scope` | enum | `rule`, `script`, `doc`, `workflow`, `code`, `test`, `process`. |
| `suggested_next_action` | enum | `file-issue`, `fold-into-<n>`, `discuss`, `defer`. |
| `confidence` | enum | `high`, `medium`, `low`. |
| `duplicate_check` | string | Search/issue compared. `none` if not checked. |

### When agents may implement directly

MAY implement without a note ONLY when BOTH hold:

1. **≤ ~20 LOC**, single file.
2. **Directly necessary** for in-scope task (not "while I'm here").

When in doubt, surface the note.

### Escalation (blocking observations)

For items that **halt current work**, use `## Blocking observation` — not the 8-field schema.

Use when: **security** (secrets, auth, injection); **data-loss** risk; **CI-breaking** change the task can't fix; **plan-invalidating** false precondition.

If unsure, treat as blocking.

## Session-state cadence

Keep agent working memory current so the next session can resume cleanly. For normal GitHub-connected work, **live coordination state lives in GitHub**, not in manually maintained repo-local markdown.

### Live coordination surface

- **Issue body** — stable task contract plus, for new issues, one delimited
  `implementation-plan:v2` block. Agents edit only that block unless the user
  explicitly authorizes another correction. Do not write live progress there.
- **PR body** — implementation/review contract. Link the issue-body plan or a
  grandfathered v1 plan comment, verification results, and latest live-state comment when relevant.
- **Latest `agent-state:v1` comment** — mutable baton for current status, blockers, next actions. Use [`.context/state/agent_state_comment_template.md`](./.context/state/agent_state_comment_template.md) as the copy/paste template.
- **Local scratch copies** — if GitHub access is temporarily unavailable, temporarily record the same `agent-state:v1` content locally. Copy it into the issue/PR comment once access returns, then discard the local scratch copy. Do not commit local live-state scratch files as the normal path or reconcile a second persistent state surface.
- **Clickable resources** — in agent-managed GitHub artifacts (plans, issue/PR
  updates, PR bodies, automated comments, and `agent-state:v1` comments), link
  every addressable issue, PR, comment, commit, branch, Actions run, ADR, or
  repository file on first mention. Use inline code only for local-only paths,
  commands, and identifiers that have no stable URL.

### `agent-state:v1` update cadence

Update or post the latest `agent-state:v1` issue/PR comment at each of these boundaries:

1. **Task start.** Record branch, current status, blockers, and next actions.
2. **Every wait-for-input pause, no exceptions.** This includes clarification questions mid-task, plan approval pauses, review-feedback pauses, and "task done, what's next?" pauses. Write now; do not defer until closeout or merge.
3. **Durability-risk boundaries.** If a single conversation exceeds ~30 turns, the runtime auto-summarizes mid-flight, or the session ends while the task is not merged/closed, update the `agent-state:v1` comment before responding to the next message. Use runtime-provided turn counters or auto-summary notices when available; otherwise self-count approximately and treat any injected conversation summary as an auto-summary boundary.
4. **Closeout.** Set `Status: done` when the agent has fully left the work.

When a turn changes repository-owned task files, commit and push those scoped
changes before updating `agent-state:v1`; the state comment then links durable
GitHub evidence. Each turn, update the comment on the active issue/PR. **Maintain a current
comprehensive snapshot — merge, do not replace, do not append:**

- **Carry forward** items still relevant; **add** new; **drop** superseded; **compress landed items
  to `references`** — when an outcome lands durably (commit/PR/doc edit), replace its prose with the pointer
  (commit SHA / PR #) since git is the permanent record. The snapshot evolves "thinking about X" →
  "X → `6315da1`".
- **Why merge, not replace:** during the *deliberation* phase (hashing out an issue/plan across many
  turns, no commit yet) the comment is the only running record; a replace would lose earlier
  decisions on compaction. **Why merge, not append:** git already captures landed work permanently, so
  accumulating per-turn JSON in the comment is redundant and hits the 65,536-char comment cap. A
  merged snapshot stays naturally bounded (superseded/landed items drop out).
- Edited **in place** (one canonical comment).
- **Rate limits:** binding limit is GitHub's secondary content-creation cap (~500/hour per user). A
  turn spans minutes → ~20–30 writes/hour even with pipeline + other agents on the same PAT (>15×
  headroom). check `x-ratelimit-remaining`/`retry-after` on 403/429 as needed.
- **Fall back to local scratch copy** on any GitHub failure / no active issue/PR.

### Post-compaction recovery gate

When the conversation contains a compaction summary or retains an exact session
ID, load the `session-recovery` skill before taking any repository action.
Recover the exact session ID, re-read the packet and required current files,
hydrate the active issue, linked PR, and latest `agent-state:v1` comment when
GitHub is available, and report the receipt with boundary `post-compaction`.
Before changing architecture, re-read any current committed failing tests and
the current issue and PR design contract; these current sources outrank the
recovery summary.

Do not treat the compaction summary alone as sufficient context. If no exact
session ID is available, ask the user. If recovery fails, stop and report the
failure rather than inferring another session or continuing from stale context.

### Postmortem feedback loop

When a downstream project (a repo built *from* this template) hits an incident worth a postmortem, run `.github/prompts/capture-postmortem.md` in that project repo. If the resulting postmortem's `generalizes:` is `Yes` or `Unclear`, run `.github/prompts/mirror-postmortem.md` against this template to mirror it back with a same-PR follow-up. The promotion policy is defined in `docs/postmortems/README.md` and ratified in [ADR-015](docs/decisions/adr-015-postmortem-feedback-loop.md). Do NOT add per-stack guidance (Terraform, Python, Rust, etc.) to this file — that is the failure mode the policy exists to prevent.

## Work style, testing, validation

### Work style

- **Branch, publish, then checkpoint each changed turn.** Before meaningful edits,
  create a non-default branch, make an empty bootstrap commit, push it, and open
  a linked draft PR. At the end of every turn that changes repository-owned task
  files, stage only task-owned paths, commit and push before updating
  `agent-state:v1`. Failing tests or incomplete behavior are not reasons to keep
  work local; record them in the draft PR and state comment. Never checkpoint
  secrets, unrelated user changes, ignored/generated artifacts, unresolved
  conflicts, or corrupt/destructive state. No-change turns create no commit.
  Checkpoint-heavy branches must be squash-merged or cleaned before review.
  Branch naming: use `feature/<task-id>` or `fix/<slug>`.
- **Surface prerequisites and edge cases** when explaining a plan or how-to: required tools, dependencies, non-obvious failure modes, safety issues. Skip boilerplate warnings on trivial work.
- **Don't weaken tests or make unrelated source changes to force them green.** If a test exposes a real bug, fix the bug in the source. Tests document behavior; weakening them to go green is a regression in disguise.
- **GitHub issue close keywords — intentional in PRs, careful in commits.** Use `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N` (and synonyms: `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved`) in the **PR description** when merge should link and close the tracked issue(s). That is the intended workflow; reference the **correct** issue numbers only. **Commit messages and squash-merge bodies also parse these keywords** when the commit lands on the default branch — a subject like `fix #N links` closes issue N even when you only meant to fix markdown URLs pointing at that issue. In commits: reference issues without a closing keyword (`issue N`, `(#N)`, `for issue N`) unless the commit itself should close the issue. **Do not use real issue numbers in bad examples** in commit or PR merge text (even as illustrations); GitHub still parses them. Repo setting **Settings → General → Issues → Auto-close issues with merged linked pull requests** controls sidebar/PR-body links; it does not fully disable commit-message keyword closes. See [linking a PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

### Testing requirements

- Follow the test pyramid: many unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E tests.
- Write tests before or alongside implementation (TDD preferred).
- All behavioral changes must include appropriate tests.
- Perform the issue's user outcome in the most representative practical environment and publish a PR-lifetime redacted artifact for every material claim. External-state and runtime claims cannot be prose-only. Use [the outcome-validation guide](docs/guides/outcome-validation.md); use the [sibling sandbox playbook](docs/guides/sandbox-verification.md) only when GitHub default-branch state is load-bearing.
- Environment selection prioritizes fidelity to the affected user's action and observable result. Cost, speed, safety, and resource use are constraints, not substitutes for fidelity; use them to choose among environments that preserve the same load-bearing conditions. For features that generate, send, deploy, publish, write, or mutate external state, perform one representative real operation. When that operation spends money or is destructive, obtain explicit approval before performing it; until approved and exercised, keep the outcome result blocked rather than narrowing the issue outcome to startup, metadata, mocks, or supporting checks.
- CI must pass before marking tasks complete. If CI fails:
  1. Read the error logs
  2. Fix the underlying issue
  3. Push and retry until green

### Validation

#### Primary validation: User outcome / 15-minute test

Before marking any non-exempt issue implementation complete, perform the issue's
`User outcome (15-minute test)` against the actual problem statement and record
the result with concrete evidence in the PR body.

Outcome validation answers: did the shipped artifact solve the user's stated
problem?

Derive the affected user's action and required observable result from the
original request and problem statement before selecting an environment. If the
planned action would still pass when that result is broken, it is supporting
verification, not user-outcome validation.

If the user outcome does not resolve the problem statement, do not patch around
the test merely to make it pass. Stop, document the framing disconnect, and
escalate to the user or revise the issue/plan.

A pragmatic user-outcome test with concrete steps and auditable material-claim
evidence is required in issues, plans, and PRs. Read and follow the
[outcome-validation guide](docs/guides/outcome-validation.md). Select the
environment from the load-bearing user conditions; the
[sandbox verification playbook](docs/guides/sandbox-verification.md) is the
specialized adapter for GitHub default-branch behavior. For example,
An issue opened to add a .md file that walks an agent through the development and
implementation of a new feature should, as part of the test and validation, walk
through and run the process defined in the .md file in a sandbox or test environment
to verify that it meets the user outcome which in turn, should solve the problem.
If this does not happen, then there is a disconnect between the user outcome
and the problem statement and that should be raised to the user for review.

#### Supporting validation

Unit tests, integration tests, `./test.sh`, lint, schema validators,
and CI are supporting regression and hygiene evidence.
They do not replace user-outcome validation.  Artifact creation, static prose
review, schema validation, or logical similarity are not sufficient evidence for
operational process/user-outcome claims.

A green CI run with no user-outcome evidence is not ready for review.

- Before each push, run focused tests covering the changed behavior and directly
  affected consumers.
- Run a broader local suite only when the change affects shared repository
  infrastructure, public contracts, multiple independently tested components,
  or consumers that cannot be bounded reliably.
- Do not duplicate a local suite when exact-head CI runs the same relevant
  commands with the capabilities required by the changed behavior. If CI skips
  or cannot exercise relevant behavior, run that missing coverage in a
  representative local environment.
- Before declaring completion, require focused local verification, user-outcome
  validation, and green required exact-head CI and lint checks.

## Reviews

Code reviews prioritize bugs, regressions, security, behavioral risk, outcome
mismatch, and missing or ineffective tests. Apply the canonical review contract
in [`.github/prompts/shared-review-lenses.md`](.github/prompts/shared-review-lenses.md)
proportionally to the available evidence.

Findings come first, ordered by the canonical AP11 priority band and then impact,
with file and line references. Each
finding must identify:

- the concrete failure mode or reasoning defect;
- the evidence supporting it;
- the affected user, behavior, or maintenance surface;
- a specific, proportionate path forward.

Before recommending block, hold, fix, reject, or merge, normalize the finding
with the `triage_version: 2` fields defined in
[`.github/prompts/shared-review-lenses.md`](.github/prompts/shared-review-lenses.md):
impact kind and magnitude, trigger likelihood, affected scope, reversibility,
fix cost, confidence, uncertainty, and optional regression-guard value. Use
`scripts/workflows/lib/finding_priority.py` (or its CLI wrapper) when executable.
If it cannot be executed, present the same fields and mark the classification
unverified; do not improvise severity or a second decision table. Classification
does not grant authority: advisory findings remain non-blocking regardless of
their derived band.

Challenge hidden assumptions and determine whether the reasoning supports the
conclusion. Check for unnecessary abstractions, speculative code or
configuration, copy-paste drift, silent failures, unhelpful errors, stale
documentation, and tests whose mocks, order dependence, or hidden global state
make them ineffective.

Reject outcome theater: CI, lint, schema checks, pre-commit hooks, and unit tests
are supporting evidence, not proof that the issue's user outcome was achieved.
Cross-reference the issue's problem statement, 15-minute test, and any problem
framing report. Flag plans or implementations that produce the wrong kind of
artifact or experience for the stated outcome.

Do not report vague criticism such as "this is bad." Explain what fails, why it
matters, and the smallest credible correction. If no findings are discovered,
state that explicitly and identify residual risk or untested behavior.

## Repo Orchestration Patterns

The P1-P10/AP1-AP11 catalog is shared vocabulary for reasoning about agent,
workflow, and coordination changes. It is descriptive, not a standalone review
gate: an ID alone never blocks a change. A finding must identify concrete harm
and map it to an active rule, observable regression, or unmet user outcome.

Authors and reviewers may cite these patterns to make design tradeoffs explicit.
Detailed history and examples remain in
`docs/guides/repo-orchestration-patterns-reference.md`.

<!-- generated:pap-catalog:begin -->
### Patterns in use

- **P1 Strategy (role specialization - deprecated):** role files provide focused strategies
  selected when specialization is worth the overhead; routine implementation
  still defaults to one agent.
- **P2 Chain of Responsibility (pipeline):** staged handlers have explicit
  pass/block criteria and short-circuit on a blocking result. The full pipeline
  is optional, not the routine default.
- **P3 Mediator (coordination):** a coordinator or explicit live-state surface
  resolves cross-agent dependencies instead of peer-to-peer hidden state.
- **P4 Adapter:** provider-specific runners wrap canonical advisory and retro
  contracts. The former multi-registry role adapters are deprecated.
- **P5 Template Method (skeletal artifacts):** plans, PRs, ADRs, and review
  artifacts use stable skeletons while allowing task-specific content.
- **P6 Facade (tool-specific entry points):** `AGENT.md`, `AI_REPO_GUIDE.md`, and
  tool instructions remain thin entry points to canonical contracts.
- **P7 Owner-Keyed Concurrent State:** concurrent state is partitioned by branch,
  issue, PR, role, or another explicit owner so independent writes can merge.
- **P8 Canonical Manifest with Generated Surfaces:** frequently repeated values
  or structures have one canonical source and deterministic native consumers
  with freshness checks when tools cannot follow a direct pointer.
- **P9 Multi-Model Plan Consensus:** high-risk or ambiguous work may compare up
  to three isolated candidate plans and synthesize one reviewable plan. It is an
  explicit opt-in technique, not default fan-out.
- **P10 Classifier:** a deterministic classifier maps explicit observed attributes
  to an operational class while keeping classification separate from the action
  taken for that class. `scripts/workflows/lib/finding_priority.py` validates the
  versioned AP11 observation contract and classifies advisory, formal/manual,
  post-merge, and weekly findings from impact magnitude, trigger likelihood,
  affected scope, reversibility, fix cost, confidence, uncertainty, and optional
  regression-guard value. Surface adapters apply authority only after deriving
  the common priority band.

### Anti-patterns to watch

- **AP1 God Object:** one file accumulates unrelated reasons to change, making
  review and context loading unreliable. Signals include many unrelated top-level
  concerns, repeated cross-domain edits, and inability to review the file in one
  focused pass. Remediate by separating stable policy from task-specific detail,
  but do not split always-needed policy into mandatory rereads.
- **AP2 Mirror Duplication:** identical substantive content is manually copied
  across files. Keep one canonical body and use pointers, symlinks, thin
  adapters, or deterministic generation where native formats are unavoidable.
- **AP3 Implicit Contract:** correctness depends on an ordering, precondition, or
  convention that exists only in contributor memory. Encode it in the closest
  contract, type, test, or workflow predicate.
- **AP4 Goal Substitution:** a change produces requested artifacts but misses the
  user action they were meant to enable. State outcomes in do-language and test
  the observable journey, not only file or endpoint existence.
- **AP5 Sequential Coupling:** useful work requires reading or executing a long
  ordered chain before the first meaningful action. Remove redundant steps and
  load task-specific context only when triggered.
- **AP6 Single-Writer Shared State:** parallel writers mutate one unpartitioned
  state record, causing conflicts or lost updates. Partition by owner or move
  coordination to a system with explicit concurrency semantics.
- **AP7 Magic String Sprawl:** labels, variables, identifiers, or route names are
  duplicated across consumers without validation. Centralize when repetition is
  frequent; otherwise add a focused cross-check when the second consumer lands.
- **AP8 Workflow-as-Application:** substantial business logic lives inside
  workflow YAML where it is difficult to test or reuse. Keep workflows as event
  wiring and move complex logic into tested scripts or actions.
- **AP9 Compatibility Surface Entrenchment:** a replacement is accepted, but the
  deprecated path remains a normal operational dependency. Stop extending the
  old surface and retire, archive, or clearly demote it.
- **AP10 Disproportionate Solution Complexity:** a solution adds custom
  components, abstractions, infrastructure, or process whose lifecycle cost is
  not justified by a verified requirement or measurable benefit. Prefer the
  simplest maintained capability that satisfies the outcome. Additional
  complexity is justified only by demonstrated constraints such as compliance,
  isolation, performance, extensibility, or reproducibility.
- **AP11 Probability Neglect:** risk handling focuses on the emotional salience
  or mere possibility of an outcome while ignoring its likelihood, exposure
  window, expected impact, mitigation cost, or opportunity cost. This can
  produce excessive prevention for rare bounded risks while common material
  risks remain under-addressed. Classify probability and impact separately,
  account for reversibility and affected scope, compare mitigations by expected
  benefit and cost, and state the evidence and uncertainty behind the
  classification. New review findings use the canonical versioned observation
  contract rather than model-authored severity; unversioned persisted records
  retain their historical classifier semantics.
