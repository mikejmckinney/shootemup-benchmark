# 40-ensure-labels.sh — Probe gh auth + create the pipeline labels.
#
# Sourced by scripts/setup.sh AFTER 00-detect-repo.sh (needs FULL_REPO).
#
# Sets these shared variables for 60-check-secrets.sh:
#   _pipeline_setup_skip_reason  — non-empty when later GitHub setup should skip
#   _gh_auth_ok                  — "true" when gh auth status succeeded
#   FULL_REPO                    — possibly upgraded via `gh repo view` fallback
#   GH_REPO                      — exported so downstream gh calls inherit scope
#
# All labels created here are documented in docs/guides/agent-pipeline.md.

# Labels consumed by the maintained agent pipeline (see
# docs/guides/agent-pipeline.md). Safe to re-run: `gh label
# create` returns non-zero when a label already exists, which we swallow.
# Requires `gh auth login` first; otherwise the whole step is skipped.
