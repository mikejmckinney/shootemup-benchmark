description: Classify and onboard to the current repository
---

Load the `repo-onboarding` skill and onboard to the current repository using
`$ARGUMENTS` as optional scope or task context.

Run the read-only classifier first. For `template-seed`, do not modify files
unless the user explicitly requested repository onboarding or confirms it.
Read only the references selected by the classified mode, validate afterward,
and return the required status line plus a concise repository brief.
