# Fusion Panel Prompt Guidance

Give every panel the same neutral, self-contained problem statement. Include:

- the goal and consequential decision;
- competing hypotheses without endorsing one;
- constraints, evidence, and prior attempts;
- relevant source paths and line ranges;
- the requested analysis dimensions and answer shape.

Ask each panel to reason independently, cite evidence, challenge assumptions,
name failure modes, and state what cannot be decided from available evidence.
Do not ask panelists to seek consensus; the Judge performs synthesis.

The runner appends the canonical completion contract from
`prompts/panel-completion.md`. Do not duplicate or override it in the caller
prompt.
