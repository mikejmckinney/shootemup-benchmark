# Agent ROI Benchmark Results

Issues: #374, #376

Evidence locations:

- Maintained evaluation lab: [`benchmark/roi`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/benchmark/roi)
- Completed harness snapshot: [`8c296458`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21)
- Locked Phase A artifacts: [`benchmark/phase-a-artifacts-20260608`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/benchmark/phase-a-artifacts-20260608)

Apparatus paths cited below resolve against the pinned completed-harness snapshot
unless another commit or tag is named. Only this canonical result record and the
retro-execution result record remain on `main` under `docs/benchmarks/`.

Status: blind scores locked for the completed benchmark sessions; sealed alias
mapping and cost addenda appended. This record covers monolithic Stage 1,
extended Stage 1, Stage 1C context injection, Stage 1D duo planner/implementer,
issue #376 orchestration pipeline runs, and Stage 1E targeted context-pack screen
(issue #378). Canonical `cursor-llm-blind-v1` regrades are complete for all of
those stages. Published **Canonical | Objective | Subjective** columns in this file
are the operator source of truth on `main`. Subjective JSON fixtures used to
compile those columns are preserved on git tag `benchmark/phase-a-artifacts-20260608`
(not merged to `main`; see the
[mainline runbook](../guides/model-roi-benchmark-runbook.md)).

This file supersedes the earlier local `grading-scores-blind.tsv` `score_10` shorthand files. Those
10-point scores were evaluator notes from blind diff review, not the official #374 weighted scoring
record. The tables below re-score the same blind evidence against the issue-defined categories:
Correctness 30, Code/doc quality 25, Repo-process adherence 20, Tool reliability 15, and Latency 10.

## Score-set comparability

Rows in this file predate the standardized grading pipeline
(`.context/benchmarks/model-roi/grading/`). Treat them as **legacy score cohorts**
unless a row explicitly cites a `score_set_id`.

- Future canonical conclusions must cite `score_set_id`, rubric version (`rubric.v1`),
  and subjective grader prompt version (`model-roi-grader-v1`).
- Stage 1 monolithic, Stage 1C, Stage 1D, pipeline (#376), and Stage 1E CP-1 rows
  include canonical `score_set_id`, objective, and subjective columns alongside legacy
  category scores (regraded via `regrade-stage.sh` / `regrade-stage-1e.sh`).
- Stage 1 monolithic, Stage 1C, Stage 1D, pipeline (#376), and Stage 1E CP-1 rows
  support canonical `score_set_id`, objective, and subjective columns alongside legacy
  category scores once regraded via the `regrade-stage-*.sh` scripts.
- Exploratory Cursor/Codex regrades are separate cohorts for inter-rater analysis;
  do not average them into canonical truth.
- Separate benchmark **execution cost** from **grading LLM cost** in ROI tables when
  subjective graders use paid models.

## Cost Normalization Status

The issue's cost formula is the canonical cost view:

```text
marginal_cost_usd = (input_tok*in_rate + output_tok*out_rate + cached_tok*cached_rate) / 1e6
cost_to_mergeable = marginal_cost_usd + sum(review_loop_costs) + human_rescue_cost
marginal_roi      = weighted_score / cost_to_mergeable

amortized_cost_per_task = monthly_plan_cost_usd / V
amortized_roi           = weighted_score / amortized_cost_per_task
```

Stage 1 has no measured review-loop costs yet, so `sum(review_loop_costs)` is `0` for this stage unless
manual rescue is explicitly recorded. Numeric marginal costs are computed only where the run captured
token telemetry and a current public rate card has enough fields to apply the formula. Copilot costs use
the recovered local `session.shutdown.totalNanoAiu` ledger from `events.jsonl`; captured
`premiumRequests` values are retained only as legacy/diagnostic metadata.

Telemetry normalization used here:

- `input_tok`: fresh/non-cached input tokens. When a runtime reports total input and cached input separately, use `fresh_input = input_tokens - cached_input_tokens` to avoid double-counting cached input.
- `output_tok`: output tokens, including reasoning output when the runtime reports it inside output totals.
- `cached_tok`: cached/cache-read input tokens.
- `token telemetry present`: enough raw token fields exist to compute `marginal_cost_usd` after unseal + rate lookup.
- `token telemetry absent`: runtime did not expose token counts; marginal ROI is `N/A` unless vendor billing exports are supplied.
- `cursor composer 2.5`: Cursor reports input, output, and cache-read tokens; Composer 2.5 Standard pricing is applied as input `$0.50`, cache read `$0.20`, and output `$2.50` per 1M tokens.

Numeric marginal ROI uses **canonical /100** numerators when `final-grades.json` exists for the alias (`stage-1-canonical-v1`, `stage-1c-canonical-v1`, `stage-1d-canonical-v1`, `stage-1-pipeline-canonical-v1`). Extended-stage aliases (`-pipe`, `-injected`, `-duo`) resolve within the matching task class so Class A and Class B rows do not collide on run index. Legacy holistic scores remain in the Legacy /100 column; Objective and Subjective are from the same compiled canonical score set.

## Class A: `opfit-281-class-a-premerge`

Canonical columns: `score_set_id=stage-1-canonical-v1`, grader `cursor-llm-blind-v1`
(true LLM blind review of each bundle's `subjective-prompt.md` via `model-roi-grader-v1`).
Legacy /100 columns retain the original holistic blind grades for comparison.
Task class: deterministic small/medium repo-process implementation.

## Per-Candidate Record Shape

Each row above maps to the issue result-record requirements:

- Run metadata: alias, task id/class, run index, base SHA, head SHA in `result.json`, and local-only artifact paths under `scripts/benchmark/runs/<task>/<alias>/r<run>/`.
- Hard gates: summarized in `Gates`; `cand-05` Class B fails acceptance due no produced work.
- Weighted score: represented by the five category columns plus `Total /100`.
- Cost: raw telemetry recorded above; numeric marginal ROI is computed below where telemetry and rates are sufficient. Amortized ROI is pending a chosen monthly plan cost and task volume `V`.
- Summary judgment: captured in the `Summary` column.

## Sealed Marginal Cost And ROI

Rate sources checked on 2026-06-04:

Cost source register:

*Table sort: Sorted by **Platform / rows** (asc).*

| Platform / rows | Source URL(s) | Rates applied | Audit caveat |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic / Claude Code rows | [Claude API pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) | Opus 4.8: `$5` input, `$10` 1h cache write, `$0.50` cache read, `$25` output. Sonnet 4.x: `$3` input, `$6` 1h cache write, `$0.30` cache read, `$15` output. Haiku 4.5: `$1` input, `$2` 1h cache write, `$0.10` cache read, `$5` output. All per 1M tokens. Claude Code runtime adds `$0.08/hour`, prorated by wall time. | Uses Claude Code reported token-cost telemetry where available, plus runtime. Family-level labels (`sonnet`, `haiku`, `opus`) are mapped to the observed or current family rate; reconcile with Claude Code export if exact snapshot billing differs. |
| Cursor Composer / Auto rows | [Cursor Models & Pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing), [Cursor pricing policy](https://cursor.com/terms/pricing/), [Composer 2.5 changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/composer-2-5) | Composer 2.5 Standard: `$0.50` input, `$0.20` cache read, `$2.50` output per 1M tokens. Cursor Auto: `$1.25` input/cache-write, `$0.25` cache-read, `$6.00` output per 1M tokens. | Cursor fixed-model rows are API-rate estimates from captured Cursor token telemetry and should be reconciled against the Cursor dashboard. Composer 2.5 Fast is not applied unless run metadata explicitly proves Fast-mode selection. |
| Cursor named provider rows | [Cursor Models & Pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing), plus the underlying provider rate card above | Captured Cursor token telemetry multiplied by the named model's public provider/API rates. | These are estimates because Cursor account billing can differ from raw provider API billing depending on pool, mode, and account terms. Dashboard export is the final bill-of-record. |
| Gemini CLI fixed-model rows | [Gemini Developer API pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing), [Vertex AI Gemini pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing) | Gemini 3 Flash Preview: `$0.50` input, `$0.05` cached, `$3.00` output. Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite: `$0.25` input, `$0.025` cached, `$1.50` output. Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview: `$2.00` input, `$0.20` cached, `$12.00` output. All per 1M tokens. | Uses captured JSON `.stats.models[*].tokens`; output cost uses `.tokens.candidates + .tokens.thoughts` because Google prices output including thinking tokens. Gemini 3.1 Pro uses the `<=200k` prompt tier as an aggregate estimate because saved stats do not expose per-request prompt length. `cand-24` requested the `gemini-3.5-flash` picker alias, but direct JSON telemetry reported `gemini-3-flash-preview`; ROI is computed from the observed backend. |
| Gemini/agy auto rows | [Gemini Developer API pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing), [Vertex AI Gemini pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing) | Uses the routed model rates from captured JSON stats when present: Flash Lite utility-router tokens plus Flash Preview main-loop tokens in the rerun rows. | Legacy agy-only runs did not expose token stats, but the patched adapter now tries direct `gemini --output-format json` first so future auto rows can capture `response` and `stats`. |
| GitHub Copilot rows | [Copilot billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-copilot-billing), [Copilot models and pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-billing/models-and-pricing) | GitHub AI Credits: `1 credit = $0.01`; Copilot `session.shutdown.totalNanoAiu` is converted with `cost_usd = totalNanoAiu / 1e11`. | Uses local `/home/codespace/.copilot/session-state/<session-id>/events.jsonl` `session.shutdown` telemetry. `totalPremiumRequests` is retained as legacy/diagnostic metadata, but ROI cost uses `totalNanoAiu` because Copilot now bills with AI credits. |
| OpenAI / Codex rows | [GPT-5.4 mini](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4-mini), [GPT-5.4](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4), [GPT-5.5](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.5/) | GPT-5.4 mini: `$0.75` input, `$0.075` cached, `$4.50` output. GPT-5.4: `$2.50` input, `$0.25` cached, `$15.00` output. GPT-5.5: `$5.00` input, `$0.50` cached, `$30.00` output. All per 1M tokens. | Uses fresh input = total input minus cached input. GPT-5.4/GPT-5.5 long-context surcharges are not applied unless per-run telemetry proves the prompt threshold was crossed. Codex recommended-default rows remain `N/A` until the selected model/rate is sealed. |

Refresh this register before publishing final benchmark conclusions, before starting a new benchmark stage,
or whenever a vendor pricing page changes. If billing exports disagree with this source register, preserve
the source-register estimate and add a billing-export reconciliation note rather than overwriting the
historical calculation silently.

## Stage 1C Context Injection Results

Stage 1C reuses the completed Stage 1 Class A/Class B results as the baseline and runs only the
`full-rules-injected` condition. The harness appended the full contents of `.context/rules/*.md` to
worktree `AGENTS.md`, added `@AGENTS.md` to `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code runs, marked injected
instruction files `skip-worktree`, and restored the instruction files before diff capture.

Injected-context metadata was captured in each run's `context-injection.json`. Because Class A and
Class B use different frozen base SHAs, the injected payload differs by task base:

| Task | Rule files | Injected `AGENTS.md` bytes | Injected `AGENTS.md` SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Class A injected | 14 | 102,729 | `102a9cc59862e2aa889e620e15f28e6c74745a2bc0f4ba152b4c7791e02aa255` |
| Class B injected | 16 | 143,054 | `c1a5a6c88c820d7944411359cec279c22179c060a7e5fb25cb94854acf442142` |

Stage 1C notes:

- Full-rule injection appears most helpful for weaker Claude rows: Haiku Class A and Class B improved materially, and Sonnet Class B improved from 66 to 82.
- The `cand-05-agents` isolation run suggests the Claude `@AGENTS.md` import accounts for much of Haiku's Class B rescue versus the no-work baseline, while full-rule injection added some quality/reliability on top.
- Full-rule injection did not improve the already-strong ROI leaders enough to justify its token cost: Composer 2.5 and Cursor Auto remained strong but lost ROI versus baseline.
- Gemini/agy Auto did not benefit in this run; both classes lost score due process/scope issues, and token telemetry remains unavailable.
- The Class B `cand-21-injected/r1` Gemini run was interrupted before terminal capture when the terminal session dropped. It was preserved as partial evidence, and `cand-21-injected/r2` is the scored terminal run.
- These results support using targeted context packs for issue #376 rather than globally injecting every rule into every agent by default.

## Stage 1D Duo Workflow Results

Stage 1D tests a two-phase workflow where a stronger or auto-routed planner produces a sealed plan and a
cheaper or auto-routed implementer executes from the same frozen base. Costs below sum planner plus
implementer telemetry. The scoring rubric remains the Stage 1 100-point rubric:
Correctness/acceptance 30, code and doc quality 25, repo-process adherence 20,
reliability/verification 15, and latency 10.

| Task | Base branch | Base SHA |

| Class A duo | `benchmark/model-roi/base-opfit-281-class-a-premerge-YYYYMMDD` | `6946d04b3fd17014e32d9da5ea947acf6df14360` |

Stage 1D notes:

- Duo planning did not beat the best monolithic ROI leaders on either class. Cursor Auto duo was competitive on Class B, but monolithic Composer 2.5 and Gemini Flash still dominated ROI where telemetry was available.
- The duo shape appears most useful when the planner can prevent weak implementers from stalling, but the extra planning turn adds cost/latency that is hard to recover on small tasks.
- Copilot Class B cost excludes the discarded failed pre-patch prompt-delivery attempt and uses only the retained successful planner and implementer sessions: `61c69de9-9249-42da-965e-86b6695749ed` and `9351dd65-b397-47d3-9542-503056d0afe6`.
- Gemini/agy duo rows used the direct `gemini --output-format json` path, not the `agy` fallback. Cost uses nested `stats.models` telemetry from the saved planner and implementer `agent-output.jsonl` files.

## Issue #376 Orchestrated Pipeline Results

Issue #376 tests whether a multi-role orchestration pipeline improves quality or ROI compared with
the monolithic Stage 1 and Stage 1C runs. The valid scored runs below use the historical premerge base
branches created for the same Class A/Class B tasks:

| Task | Base branch | Base SHA |
|---|---|---|
| Class A pipeline | `benchmark/model-roi/base-opfit-281-class-a-premerge-pipeline-ref-20260604` | `6946d04b3fd17014e32d9da5ea947acf6df14360` |
| Class B pipeline | `benchmark/model-roi/base-opfit-326-class-b-premerge-pipeline-ref-20260604` | `cff89bffe7e15e155bd740b6c7a0f158a6f2bad6` |

Issue #376 uses a pipeline-specific 100-point rubric:
Correctness/acceptance 30, code and doc quality 20, repo-process adherence 15,
end-to-end reliability 15, coordination efficiency 10, and latency 10.

Cost/ROI is computed where the scored pipeline run captured usable telemetry. Copilot pipeline rows use
recovered local `session.shutdown.totalNanoAiu` from `events.jsonl`; Gemini/agy rows still need a session
`/stats model` recovery because the agy output did not emit token/model usage into `agent-output.jsonl`.

### Issue #376 Class A: `opfit-281-class-a-premerge-pipeline`

Canonical columns: `score_set_id=stage-1-pipeline-canonical-v1`, grader `cursor-llm-blind-v1`
(true LLM blind review; pipeline bundles use `rubric.pipeline.v1` including coordination).
Rows with numeric cost are sorted by marginal ROI; rows requiring external telemetry are left as `N/A`.

Issue #376 run notes:

- Invalid or setup-failed pipeline attempts are excluded from the scored tables. The valid corrected runs are Class A `r2` for `cand-03-pipe`, `cand-12-pipe`, `cand-05-pipe`; Class A `r3` for `cand-20-pipe`, `cand-21-pipe`; and Class B `r2` for all five aliases.
- Earlier Class A `r1` attempts used the wrong current-main base SHA and are retained only as invalid setup evidence, not benchmark evidence.
- `cand-20-pipe` and `cand-21-pipe` required overlay seeding for historical bases that did not yet contain `.cursor/agents` or `.agents`.
- H1, tiered orchestration quality: not proven. `cand-03-pipe` had strong coordination evidence, but latency was too high to clearly beat the best monolithic ROI rows.
- H2, orchestration overhead on simple work: supported. Class A pipeline runs were generally slower and did not materially improve quality over the strongest monolithic baselines.
- H3, cheap same-model orchestration: not supported for hard work. Haiku solved Class A slowly but produced no Class B work.
- H4, crossover point: no favorable crossover was observed in these two tasks. Cursor Auto pipeline is the strongest practical pipeline result, but monolithic Cursor/Auto/Composer-style baselines remain the better ROI direction unless coordination quality is explicitly required.

## Stage 1E Targeted Context-Pack Results

Canonical columns: `score_set_id=stage-1e-canonical-v1-*`, grader `cursor-llm-blind-v1`
(true LLM blind review of each CP-1 bundle's `subjective-prompt.md` via `model-roi-grader-v1`).
Stage 1E tests targeted context packs as a middle path between lazy loading and
full `.context/rules/*.md` injection. It reuses the historical Class A and Class B
frozen bases from issues #374/#376 and measures whether smaller named context
bundles improve quality enough to offset added token/cache cost.

Tracking issue: #378. CP-1 screen manifest:
`.context/benchmarks/model-roi/stage-1e-pack-screen-candidates.tsv.example`
(`ctx-cur` = cursor / composer-2.5; `ctx-gem` = gemini-cli / gemini-3.5-flash
requested). Scores locked 2026-06-06 from diff-only grading before unseal;
locked rows in `scripts/benchmark/runs/stage-1e-blind-scores-locked.tsv`.
Marginal cost/ROI from per-run `agent-output.jsonl` (JSON stats for Gemini; top-level `.usage` for Cursor) using Stage 1 rate cards. **ROI numerators use canonical /100 scores** (`cursor-llm-blind-v1`).
(JSON stats for Gemini; top-level `.usage` for Cursor) using the same Stage 1
rate cards below.

**Base context note:** candidates ran against frozen-base `AGENTS.md`, not the
current workspace copy. Class A base `6946d04…` carried **AGENTS.md v14**; Class B
base `cff89bf…` carried **AGENTS.md v20**. Pack manifests were resolved from the
harness at run time (issue #378 implementation tree).

### Context variants and packs (CP-1 matrix)

Stage 1E compares five **context conditions** per task class. Each row in the
tables below sets `CONTEXT_VARIANT` on the harness; pack rows inject the listed
files into the worktree's `AGENTS.md` for the run only (skip-worktree restore
before diff capture). Manifests live under
[`context-packs/`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/.context/benchmarks/model-roi/context-packs).

| Context variant | CP-1 Class A | CP-1 Class B | Pack files | Pack bytes (typ.) | What it adds |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `baseline` | yes | yes | 0 | 0 | **No injection.** Frozen-base `AGENTS.md` only — lazy-load / pointer-table discipline with no extra pack append. Control arm for token cost and scope. |
| `pack:core-min` | yes | yes | 3 | ~28k | **Smallest targeted floor:** context map, path ownership, and recent session lessons. Manifest: [`context-packs/core-min.tsv`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/blob/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/.context/benchmarks/model-roi/context-packs/core-min.tsv). |
| `pack:class-a-process` | yes | no | 6 | ~46k | **Class A process/doc arm:** `core-min` plus PR completion, doc-sync triggers, work-style/testing expectations, and opportunity-feedback. Manifest: [`context-packs/class-a-process.tsv`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/blob/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/.context/benchmarks/model-roi/context-packs/class-a-process.tsv). |
| `pack:class-b-implementation` | no | yes | 6 | ~50k | **Class B code/reasoning arm:** `core-min` plus code-quality, work-style/testing, and doc-sync guidance. Manifest: [`context-packs/class-b-implementation.tsv`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/blob/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/.context/benchmarks/model-roi/context-packs/class-b-implementation.tsv). |
| `full-rules-injected` | yes | yes | 14 / 16 | ~103k / ~143k | **Stage 1C-style full rule dump:** all `.context/rules/*.md` appended to `AGENTS.md` (14 rule files on Class A base, 16 on Class B base because the frozen bases differ). Upper-bound cost/quality comparison vs targeted packs — not a production default. |

CP-1 did **not** screen `workflow-risk` or `adr-docs` packs (defined in
[`context-packs/README.md`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/blob/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/.context/benchmarks/model-roi/context-packs/README.md) for future stages).

Per-row **Pack files** / **Pack bytes** in the score tables are measured at run
time from the resolved manifest + injection metadata, not from this summary.

Score delta is vs the same alias's `baseline` **canonical** score for this task class
(e.g. `ctx-cur` pack rows compare to `ctx-cur` + `baseline`, not to `ctx-gem`).
ROI = `canonical / cost_usd`; ROI delta is vs the same alias's `baseline` marginal ROI.
Baseline rows always show `0` for both deltas. Recompute after canonical regrades:
`python3 scripts/benchmark/update-stage-1e-roi.py`.
Gemini costs use JSON `.stats.models[*].tokens` and Gemini 3 Flash Preview rates; Cursor
costs use top-level `.usage` and Composer 2.5 Standard rates (see Stage 1 rate card).

Category scores in the legacy columns are from blind diff grading
(`scripts/benchmark/runs/stage-1e-blind-scores-locked.tsv` for the exploratory
pass). Canonical columns use `stage-1e-canonical-v1-*` score sets compiled from
`scripts/benchmark/grade-bundles/` (grader `cursor-llm-blind-v1`, blind review of each bundle's `subjective-prompt.md` + diff). Legacy and canonical
totals differ because `rubric.v1` splits objective automation from subjective
review.

### Context-pack comparison

*Table sort: Sorted by **mean ROI** (desc).*

| Task class | Pack / variant | Mean canonical /100 | Mean cost | Mean ROI | Scope-noise count | Process-miss count | Recommendation |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| A | `pack:core-min` | 65.0 | `$0.127432` | `510.05` | 2 | 2 | Not recommended — weaker mean canonical score on both aliases |
| A | `baseline` | 63.0 | `$0.149483` | `454.21` | 0 | 1 | **Default for Class A** — best mean ROI; `ctx-gem` canonical leader |
| A | `full-rules-injected` | 63.5 | `$0.198915` | `418.81` | 0 | 1 | High `ctx-gem` ROI but tied mean score; avoid default injection |
| A | `pack:class-a-process` | 62.5 | `$0.179343` | `392.77` | 1 | 1 | Optional **cursor-only** pack — strong cursor ROI vs baseline |
| B | `pack:core-min` | 81.5 | `$0.283119` | `317.66` | 1 | 0 | **Default targeted pack for Class B** — best mean ROI; near top canonical scores |
| B | `baseline` | 72.5 | `$0.393312` | `183.51` | 5 | 4 | Under-delivered on this task without targeted context |
| B | `pack:class-b-implementation` | 76.0 | `$0.436897` | `173.48` | 4 | 3 | Not recommended |
| B | `full-rules-injected` | 82.0 | `$0.549391` | `158.31` | 2 | 1 | Highest `ctx-gem` canonical score but ~2× mean cost vs `core-min` |

Mean score, mean cost, and mean ROI average the two CP-1 aliases (`ctx-cur`, `ctx-gem`) per pack/variant.

### Stage 1E model verification

| Alias | Requested | Observed (all 8 runs) | Verification source | agy fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ctx-cur` | `composer-2.5` | `composer-2.5` (unverified by JSON) | `--model` pin + agent self-report in `result` text; JSON has `.usage` only | n/a |
| `ctx-gem` | `gemini-3.5-flash` | `gemini-3-flash-preview` | `agent-output.jsonl` → `.stats.models` keys; adapter remap in `effort-applied.txt` | none |

Gemini did **not** run a literal `gemini-3.5-flash` API model — same adapter behavior as Stage 1 `cand-24`
(`gemini-3.5-flash` picker alias → `gemini-3-flash-preview` backend). No `agy` fallback occurred.

**Why Cursor “model” was not in the first CP-1 results pass:** Stage 1 never recorded Cursor's
chosen model from JSON either — `cursor-agent --output-format json` returns token usage but
**no model field** (verified on Stage 1 `cand-06` and Stage 1E `ctx-cur` artifacts). Stage 1
listed `cursor / composer-2.5` from the sealed manifest and `effort-applied.txt`, not from
runtime telemetry. The benchmark prompt also injects `candidate_model:` into the rendered prompt,
and agents echo it in the final text summary (`Alias / Platform / Model` block) — that
self-report was present in Stage 1E `agent-output.jsonl` `result` text but was not extracted into
the first results tables. Copilot **auto** rows are different: those can show a routed model from
session shutdown events (`cand-19`), which is why the original suite may feel more explicit for
some platforms than for pinned Cursor runs.

### Stage 1E notes

- **Canonical-score leader (Class A):** `full-rules-injected` / `ctx-gem` (65); legacy holistic was 92.
- **Canonical-score leader (Class B):** `full-rules-injected` / `ctx-gem` (80); legacy holistic was 88.
- **ROI winner (Class A):** `baseline` on mean ROI (`454.21`); per-alias peaks: `pack:class-a-process` / `ctx-cur` (`526.04`, +197.19 vs baseline) and `full-rules-injected` / `ctx-gem` (`626.83`, +47.26 vs baseline).
- **ROI winner (Class B):** `pack:core-min` / `ctx-gem` (`401.08`, +243.57 vs baseline) — `full-rules` still leads canonical score on `ctx-gem` but trails on ROI at higher cost.
- **Canonical vs ROI winner differ:** yes for Class B (`full-rules` canonical leader on `ctx-gem`, `core-min` ROI leader).
- **>3pt canonical degradation under a pack:** Class A `pack:core-min` and `pack:class-a-process` on `ctx-gem` (-10 and -7 vs baseline canonical 72); Class B packs improved `ctx-gem` vs baseline canonical 59.
- **Full-rule injection dominated?** Class A: yes for cursor (worse canonical, more bytes, lower ROI). Class B: full-rules leads canonical on `ctx-gem` but `core-min` wins ROI at ~48% lower mean cost.
- **Baseline lazy best?** Class A: competitive mean ROI (`501.04`) with lowest mean cost; Class B no — baseline under-delivered; `pack:core-min` helps both aliases.
- **Telemetry:** token counts captured in `agent-output.jsonl` for all 16 runs (`--output-format json`); `session-summary` sidecar not available in this `gemini` CLI build and was not required for cost. CP-2 robustness not yet run.

### Proposed follow-up: context loading policy

- **Default:** baseline lazy loading.
- **Class A:** no automatic injection by default; optional `pack:class-a-process` when cursor/composer runs need stronger process/doc-sync reminders (accept ~1–2pt tradeoffs on some models).
- **Class B:** `pack:core-min` when code/test reasoning risk is high and baseline lazy under-delivers.
- **Avoid:** `full-rules-injected` by default — use only for measured rescue cases or explicit human opt-in.
- **Exception:** re-benchmark on current `AGENTS.md` (v22 decomposition) before changing production routing; CP-1 bases used v14/v20.

These results support `pack:core-min` as the default targeted pack for Class B benchmark-like work and **baseline lazy loading** (not automatic pack injection) for Class A, subject to future reruns when model pricing, `AGENTS.md` version, or context-loading behavior changes.

## Amortized / Subscription ROI

Not used as the primary Stage 1 ranking view.

For this benchmark, the primary ROI question is model/agent performance per credit/token cost. Every
candidate platform requires some subscription or account access, so choosing an arbitrary monthly task
volume `V` before seeing benchmark results would make the subscription allocation dominate the ranking
and could obscure the actual model/runtime cost-performance signal.

Use amortized/subscription math only as a secondary adoption or break-even view:

```text
amortized_cost_per_task = monthly_plan_cost_usd / V
amortized_roi           = weighted_score / amortized_cost_per_task
```

For Copilot, the known access cost is `$39/month`, but `V` should be derived from the eventual routing
decision or measured real usage, not guessed up front. In other words, after the benchmark identifies
which candidates are worth using, compute how many qualifying tasks per month are needed for the fixed
subscription to make sense.

Do not double-count hybrid plans: for Copilot, use token/credit marginal cost for the primary ROI view,
and use the `$39/month` subscription only in a separate break-even/adoption view.

## Session Handshake Capture

The current harness asked candidates to emit the AGENTS.md handshake and final compliance summary. Raw
`agent-output.jsonl` logs can be scanned for this evidence, but the signal is not normalized into
`result.json` yet.

| Task | Alias/run | Handshake evidence found in `agent-output.jsonl` |
|---|---|---|
| Class A core | all 8 locked-score runs | yes |
| Class A extended | `cand-07/r1` through `cand-10/r1`, `cand-11/r2`, `cand-12/r1`, `cand-13/r1`, `cand-14/r1`, `cand-15/r4`, `cand-16/r4` | yes |
| Class A extended | `cand-19/r1`, `cand-20/r2`, `cand-21/r5`, `cand-23/r1`, `cand-24/r2` | yes |
| Class A extended | `cand-22/r1`, `cand-22/r2` | not applicable; prompt parsing failed before a valid run |
| Class B | all completed scored runs except `cand-04/r1` | yes; includes telemetry reruns `cand-21/r2` and `cand-24/r1` |
| Class B | `cand-04/r1` | not found by simple handshake-string scan |

Recommended next benchmark revision: add `handshake_emitted`, `session_context_receipt_emitted`, and
`reported_read_profile` fields to `result.json` so compliance scoring does not depend on brittle raw-log
searches.
