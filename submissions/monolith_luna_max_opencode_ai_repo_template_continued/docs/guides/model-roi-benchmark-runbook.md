# Model ROI Benchmark Runbook

This guide is the canonical operator entry point for the repository's occasional
agent/model ROI campaigns. Benchmark apparatus is an evaluation lab, not part of
the reusable template shipped from `main`.

## Canonical Surfaces

| Surface | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Operator guide | This file on `main` | Campaign preparation, execution, and publication |
| Model-ROI results | [`docs/benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md`](../benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md) | Published score sets, costs, and conclusions |
| Retro results | [`docs/benchmarks/retro-execution-447-results.md`](../benchmarks/retro-execution-447-results.md) | Published retro execution comparison |
| Evaluation workspace | [`benchmark/roi`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/benchmark/roi) | Harness, tasks, prompts, schemas, graders, and local run inputs |
| Completed apparatus snapshot | [`8c296458`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21) | Immutable reference for the last mainline apparatus state |
| Locked Phase A artifacts | [`benchmark/phase-a-artifacts-20260608`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/benchmark/phase-a-artifacts-20260608) | Subjective grader output and raw retained evidence |

ADR-031 owns benchmark policy and current execution recommendations. Results on
`main` are decision evidence; the mutable lab branch is never itself a published
result citation.

## Prerequisites

- A clean clone with `origin` pointing to this repository.
- Git, Bash, Python 3, `jq`, and the agent CLIs selected for the campaign.
- Authentication for each selected provider.
- An approved issue and plan defining task classes, candidate matrix, spending
  limit, frozen bases, grading rubric, and user-outcome test.
- Explicit maintainer approval before any paid candidate invocation.

Never commit provider credentials, unsealed candidate mappings, generated
worktrees, raw prompts containing secrets, or local billing exports.

## Synchronize The Lab

Synchronize `benchmark/roi` immediately before a campaign. A normal merge would
apply `main`'s deliberate apparatus deletions to the lab branch, so preserve the
lab-owned paths from the branch tip while accepting all other `main` changes.

```bash
git fetch origin --tags
git switch benchmark/roi
git pull --ff-only origin benchmark/roi

lab_tip="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/main

git restore --source="$lab_tip" -- \

git commit -m "Merge main into benchmark/roi for campaign"
```

If the merge reports conflicts outside the listed lab paths, stop and resolve
them as normal repository changes. Do not use `git merge -s ours`: that would
hide rather than integrate `main` changes.

After synchronization, update stale protocol references on `benchmark/roi` to
point to this guide and `docs/benchmarks/`. The old branch-local runbook is not a
second canonical copy. Before the next campaign, update any harness paths that
still target branch-local results, then remove the old runbook and result copies
from `benchmark/roi` in that campaign's preparation commit.

## Prepare A Campaign

1. Create a feature branch from the synchronized `benchmark/roi` tip.
2. Select committed task specs and record their task class.
3. Freeze or explicitly reuse base SHAs. Never mix rows from different bases
   without a comparability warning.
4. Copy an example candidate manifest to its ignored local filename and keep
   alias-to-model mappings sealed until grading is locked.
5. Verify requested model identifiers against observed runtime telemetry.
6. Run the non-spending doctor gate before invoking a candidate.

Typical preflight:

```bash
make -C scripts/benchmark doctor STAGE=1 BASE=<base-sha>
```

The doctor must validate the task, prompt, manifest, base, required binaries,
authentication heuristics, writable artifact directories, and remote state.

## Run Candidates

Use the same candidate prompt, task body, frozen base, effort policy, and run
index convention for every comparable row.

```bash
make -C scripts/benchmark suite \
  TASK=<task-id> \
  BASE=<base-sha> \
  STAGE=1
```

Run one alias while diagnosing an adapter:

```bash
make -C scripts/benchmark run \
  TASK=<task-id> \
  BASE=<base-sha> \
  ALIAS=<candidate-alias>
```

Prefer sequential execution when wall-clock comparisons matter. Parallel runs
introduce host-load and provider-rate-limit noise. Record manual fallbacks as
manual; never relabel a blocked automated run as automated success.

## Collect And Grade

Keep grader-facing and sealed artifacts separate. Blind bundles use neutral
evaluation IDs and must not expose provider, model, framework condition, or
candidate aliases.

```bash
make -C scripts/benchmark collect TASK=<task-id>
./scripts/benchmark/regrade-stage.sh <stage> prepare
./scripts/benchmark/regrade-stage.sh <stage> grade <grader-id>
./scripts/benchmark/regrade-stage.sh <stage> record <grader-id> <responses-dir>
./scripts/benchmark/regrade-stage.sh <stage> compile <grader-id>
```

Scores are comparable only within the same `score_set_id`, rubric version,
grader prompt version, task, and frozen base. Separate candidate execution cost
from grading-model cost.

Unseal only after scores are locked:

```bash
make -C scripts/benchmark unseal TASK=<task-id>
```

## Publish Results

1. Update the appropriate file under `docs/benchmarks/` on a normal feature
   branch from current `main`.
2. Record task, base SHA, apparatus commit, artifact tag, candidate alias,
   requested and observed model, score set, rubric, grader, cost source, wall
   time, and caveats.
3. Cite immutable commits, tags, Actions runs, issues, and PRs. Do not cite the
   mutable `benchmark/roi` head as evidence.
4. Amend ADR-031 only when the new evidence changes repository policy.
5. Run the normal repository verification and sandbox user-outcome process for
   the publication PR.

Raw run directories, worktrees, response bundles, manifests that reveal model
identity, and local logs remain off `main`. Preserve evidence needed to reproduce
published conclusions in an immutable tag.

## Known Boundaries

- Class A/B evidence does not establish universal model quality.
- Class C greenfield comparison remains incomplete until a planned campaign runs.
- Pricing, model aliases, and routed backends change; refresh rate cards and
  record observed models for every campaign.
- Context-pack conclusions must be revalidated after material `AGENTS.md` or
  repository-process changes.
- Production code and tests promoted from benchmark findings stay on `main`; do
  not move them back into the evaluation lab.
