# ADR-031: Agent/model ROI benchmark and execution lifecycle policy

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-06-15

## Amendment 2026-07-15 — Isolate benchmark apparatus

Benchmark harnesses, prompts, tasks, schemas, grading tools, and benchmark-only
checks live on `benchmark/roi`. `main` retains this policy, the canonical
operator guide, and published result records under `docs/`. The completed
pre-isolation apparatus is pinned at
[`8c296458`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21),
and raw Phase A evidence remains tagged at
[`benchmark/phase-a-artifacts-20260608`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/benchmark/phase-a-artifacts-20260608).

## Context

Issue [#374](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/issues/374) and follow-ons ([#376](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/issues/376), [#378](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/issues/378)) produced a reproducible **model ROI benchmark harness** (Phase A merged in PR [#379](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/pull/379)). Issue [#483](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/issues/483) later isolated the apparatus on `benchmark/roi`. Scored results live in [`docs/benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md`](../benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md).

Until this ADR, benchmark **procedure** and **actionable recommendations** were scattered across:

- the `benchmark/roi` README and runbook (operator protocol)
- Issue comments and prompt pack notes (ad hoc guidance)
- Partial pointers in [ADR-019](./adr-019-per-role-model-tiering.md) (tier policy deferred pending benchmark refresh)

Operators and agents need a single durable **policy surface** for:

1. How to run and extend benchmarks (without re-deriving protocol from issues).
2. What the completed Class A / Class B evidence supports **today** for model, context, and orchestration choices.
3. What is **still missing** (Class C greenfield) and when to re-run.

Issue [#474](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/issues/474)
applied the benchmark result to the repository's operating model. Maintaining
unused role registries, platform overlays, and separate formal-review stages
continued to create drift after the evidence favored monolithic execution.

Benchmark evidence is **not static**. Platforms rename models, pricing changes, agent runtimes change tool behavior, and repo process (`AGENTS.md`, context packs, subagent dispatch) evolves. Recommendations here are **current as of the cited score sets** and must be revisited when those inputs change materially.

## Decision

### 1. Canonical benchmark procedure

We treat the following as the **single operator contract** for agent/model ROI benchmarks in this repo:

| Surface | Role |
|---|---|
| [`8c296458` protocol](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/blob/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/.context/benchmarks/model-roi/README.md) | Protocol, artifact model, task classes, stage definitions |
| [`docs/guides/model-roi-benchmark-runbook.md`](../guides/model-roi-benchmark-runbook.md) | Canonical setup, synchronization, run, grade, and publication procedure |
| [`8c296458` grading](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/.context/benchmarks/model-roi/grading) | Rubrics, schemas, score-set comparability rules |
| [`8c296458` harness](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/tree/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/scripts/benchmark) | Harness entrypoints (`make doctor`, `base`, `run`, `suite`, `regrade-stage.sh`, etc.) |
| [`8c296458` candidate prompt](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/blob/8c2964583af04b3352561410e22511304001ec21/.github/prompts/model-roi-benchmark-candidate.md) | Shared candidate prompt body (task injected per run) |
| [`docs/benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md`](../benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md) | Scored record and ROI tables (operator source of truth on `main`) |
| [`docs/benchmarks/retro-execution-447-results.md`](../benchmarks/retro-execution-447-results.md) | Retro execution benchmark record |

**Primary ranking metric:** **marginal ROI** = canonical weighted score ÷ marginal cost USD (token telemetry × public rate card where available). Amortized/subscription ROI is secondary unless explicitly scoped.

**Task classes (Phase A completed unless noted):**

| Class | Description | Committed tasks | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Operational fit — small/medium repo-process implementation | `opfit-281-class-a` (+ pipeline variant) | Benchmarked (Stage 1, 1C, 1D, 1E, #376 pipeline) |
| **B** | Reasoning / code — harder implementation | `opfit-326-class-b` (+ pipeline variant) | Benchmarked (same stages) |
| **C** | Greenfield app / framework comparison | Planned on `benchmark/roi` | **Not yet run** — required for a complete picture |

**Blind / sealed discipline:** alias manifests, frozen bases, blind grading before unseal, and `score_set_id` citation for canonical conclusions (see grading README).

Before a benchmark campaign, synchronize `benchmark/roi` from current `main` and
refresh its operator contract for any repository changes. The pinned snapshot
above is the completed-campaign reference; result-only changes to `main` follow
the normal repository contract.

### 2. Current recommendations (Phase A evidence)

These recommendations apply to **routine repo implementation and non-blocking review automation** unless a task explicitly requires multi-role coordination quality as the primary goal.

#### 2a. Default execution shape: monolithic over multi-role pipeline

Issue #376 tested repo-native **orchestration pipelines** (subagents + handoffs) against completed monolithic Stage 1 baselines on the same Class A/B tasks.

**Finding:** No favorable ROI crossover was observed. Monolithic Cursor Auto / Composer-style runs and strong Gemini Flash rows remain the better default direction; pipeline runs were generally slower, often costlier, and did not materially improve quality on simple Class A work ([`agent-roi-benchmark-results.md` § Issue #376](../benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md)).

**Policy:**

- **Prefer a single implementing agent** (monolithic pass) for routine issue/PR implementation, retro fix passes, and weekly fix passes.
- **Do not use subagent fan-out for routine repository work.** The role registry is retired; use `multi-model-consensus` only when independent multi-model review is explicitly justified.
- **Stage 1D duo** (planner + implementer) did not beat the best monolithic ROI leaders on either class; treat duo as experimental, not default.

This supersedes ADR-019's active role-tiering guidance while preserving that
ADR as historical benchmark context.

#### 2b. Model / platform shortlist (where telemetry exists)

For **implementation-shaped** work (Classes A/B), Phase A marginal ROI and canonical scores support:

| Tier | Candidates | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **First choice (implementation)** | Cursor **Composer 2.5**, Gemini **Flash** (requested `gemini-3.5-flash` → observed `gemini-3-flash-preview` backend in harness), Cursor **Auto** | Strong score/ROI on both classes when telemetry captured |
| **Use with care** | Copilot **Auto** (routed model varies), Codex default | Useful rows exist; verify routed model and partial-run caveats |
| **Escalation / gates** | High-tier models per ADR-019 (Opus-class, GPT-5.4 xhigh on Copilot parent for reasoning-heavy parent sessions) | Not default for routine implementation; use for plan-gate, diff-gate, architecture, hard review resolution |

Advisory/retro **CI defaults** are governed by [ADR-030](./adr-030-non-blocking-review-pipeline.md) and workflow vars. Pre-merge advisory uses Claude Opus 5 Medium, Sol 5.6 Medium, Cursor Grok 4.5 Medium, then Kimi K3. Its 2026-08-02 recurring-analysis amendment places Claude first in daily and weekly analysis while leaving both fix cascades unchanged. GPT-5.6 Sol remains the first multi-model Judge/Advisor model, now with medium effort. This ADR informs those choices but does not replace per-workflow environment documentation.

#### 2c. Context loading (Stage 1C / 1E)

**Do not** inject full `.context/rules/*.md` by default. Full-rule injection rarely improved ROI for already-strong models and often increased cost.

**Stage 1E targeted packs (benchmark evidence only — production routing still requires explicit policy PR):**

| Work shape | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Class A** (process/doc-heavy small changes) | **Baseline lazy loading** default; optional `pack:class-a-process` for Cursor when process/doc-sync reminders help (accept small score tradeoffs) |
| **Class B** (code/reasoning-heavy) | **`pack:core-min`** when baseline lazy under-delivers; avoid `full-rules-injected` as default |

Sweet-spot rule (from benchmark README): highest marginal ROI pack within **−2** canonical points of the class best, no **>3** point model-specific degradation, fewer bytes than full-rules injection.

**Caveat:** Stage 1E CP-1 used frozen bases with older `AGENTS.md` versions (v14/v20). Re-benchmark before changing production context-loading policy on current `AGENTS.md`.

#### 2d. What Phase A does **not** yet justify

- **Class C greenfield** app/framework benchmarks (planned on `benchmark/roi`) — **still required** for complete adoption decisions on greenfield work and framework comparison (ai-repo-template vs Spec Kit).
- **Stage 1E CP-2** robustness screen — deferred.
- **Copilot overlay remap** to GPT-5.4 xhigh or verified fallback arrays — still deferred pending refreshed #220 benchmark tranche ([ADR-019](./adr-019-per-role-model-tiering.md)).
- Production changes to default read profiles or workflow model variables based solely on Class A/B premerge tasks.

#### 2e. Active execution and review lifecycle

The repository applies the benchmark recommendation as follows:

- Routine implementation uses one monolithic implementing agent.
- CI and lint are the blocking pre-merge controls.
- Advisory review is normal agent practice via `ai-review:live` for every eligible
  same-repository task PR. It runs in parallel with active implementation, updates
  one sticky comment, and cannot mutate or block the PR.
- Daily post-merge retro and weekly full-repository review remain the recurring
  review and draft-fix pipelines.
- `.agents/skills/multi-model-consensus/` is the sole opt-in multi-model mechanism.
- One shared review contract feeds advisory, daily, and weekly prompts; cadence
  prompts retain only their evidence boundary and output interface. The shared
  contract supplies versioned AP11 observation fields; deterministic automation
  derives priority while each review surface retains its own authority.
- Canonical roles, platform overlays, native reviewer rules, multi-role dispatch,
  formal AI review, review resolution, finalization, and legacy consensus
  planning are retired.
- Cross-PR overlap visibility remains; issue assignment and branch updates are
  operator-owned.

This lifecycle supersedes ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-008, ADR-009, ADR-014,
ADR-019, ADR-023, and ADR-024 for active operations. Their bodies and benchmark
artifacts remain historical evidence. ADR-007 remains superseded through ADR-008.

#### Amendment 2026-07-22 — Advisory review as normal parallel practice

Agents apply `ai-review:live` when they create or claim an eligible
same-repository task PR, then continue implementation without waiting. Before
completion they independently verify any findings from an arrived snapshot whose
`Head` matches the current PR head. Missing, stale, running, or failed feedback is
recorded but never blocks completion or merge. Forks, `smoke-test` PRs, and
repositories without the workflow, label, provider credentials, or label-write
permission are exempt. CI, lint, sandbox verification, user-outcome validation,
and maintainer controls remain authoritative.

The sticky snapshot carries automation-owned provider/model identity and a
bounded hidden provider-neutral memory record. Compatible pushes review the
accumulated delta from the last completed head; readiness, full mode, base or
expected-provider changes, invalid memory, and rewritten ancestry force a full
refresh. This avoids persisting provider-native sessions or runner databases,
keeps fallback portable, and lets canceled runs recover from the last completed
snapshot. No-findings output is explicit rather than an empty table.

#### Amendment 2026-07-28 — Priority-gated retro fixes and weekly scan budget

Daily retrospective findings remain visible in the dated umbrella regardless of
priority, but deterministic automation sends only non-superseded `should-fix`
and `fix-now` findings to the fix provider. A defer-only batch therefore retains
its review record without spending a fix attempt or creating a draft PR.

The weekly full-repository scan receives a 120-minute job budget after a real run
was canceled at the prior 60-minute boundary. Its OAuth eligibility guard rises
to 8,100 seconds, preserving the complete job budget plus 15 minutes. The
separate weekly fix job remains at 60 minutes and 4,500 seconds because no
evidence supports widening that budget.

#### Amendment 2026-07-17 — Multi-model skill identity and Fusion panel

The public skill identity moves from `local-consensus` to
`multi-model-consensus`; callers must update the directory, skill slug, and
`LOCAL_CONSENSUS_*` overrides to `.agents/skills/multi-model-consensus/`,
`multi-model-consensus`, and `MULTI_MODEL_CONSENSUS_*`. No deprecated alias is
retained. Fusion uses OpenRouter Kimi K3, Fable, and Cursor Grok as primary
panels, then backfills with Sol, GLM, MiniMax, MiMo, and DeepSeek. Judge/Advisor
ordering remains Sol, Fable, Grok, then GLM.

#### Amendment 2026-07-18 - Risk-based problem framing and critical review

The monolithic implementing agent validates the problem and user outcome before
designing implementation when work introduces net-new behavior, has ambiguous
scope, makes a user-facing product choice, or is costly or difficult to reverse.
Routine deterministic fixes and behavior-neutral maintenance do not acquire a
mandatory framing stage unless their expected behavior is itself ambiguous.

This is a reasoning contract, not a restoration of the retired Analyst, Judge,
or Critic roles. It adds no role handoff, pipeline stage, verdict, or mandatory
approval pause. `AGENTS.md` contains the concise normative policy, while
`docs/guides/problem-framing.md` provides an optional detailed scaffold for
product and market decisions.

Critical review must identify the concrete failure mode, evidence, affected
surface, and a proportionate path forward. Supporting checks cannot substitute
for the issue's user-outcome test. Conditional impact dimensions remain separate
and evidence-backed rather than being collapsed into a composite score.

Class C greenfield work remains unbenchmarked. This amendment therefore does not
claim that deeper framing improves model ROI for all product work; it bounds the
new policy by consequence and ambiguity and requires sandbox dogfood before the
change is treated as complete.

### 3. Revisit cadence

Re-run benchmark stages or amend this ADR when **any** of the following change materially:

- Platform model catalogs, pricing, or API telemetry shape
- Agent runtime / SDK / CLI adapter behavior on `benchmark/roi`
- Repo orchestration: `AGENTS.md` version, context-pack layout, subagent dispatch contract, or role overlays
- Task class definitions or grading rubrics (`grading/rubric.v*.md`)
- Observed production ROI drift (e.g., advisory/retro cost or quality regressions)

**Minimum:** review recommendations **quarterly** or before any ADR-019 overlay remap PR.

Class C results, when available, must be merged into this ADR (or a superseding ADR) before claiming benchmark completeness.

### OpenCode rollout evidence requirement

Issue #480 changes the runtime/tool boundary rather than claiming that the new
models outperform prior benchmark leaders. Before removing the retained
Cursor/Gemini adapters, compare sandbox advisory, daily, and weekly runs against
the latest successful Cursor runs for schema success, elapsed time, token/tool
context, finding usefulness, and fix verification. Record requested and observed
models, locked runtime version, and GitHub runner image release. A regression in evidence completeness,
structured-output reliability, or fix isolation reverses `auto` to Cursor while
the OpenCode adapter remains available explicitly.

## Amendment 2026-06-15 — Slim `.context/rules/` catalog (issue #437 / PR #438)

**Motivation:** Phase A benchmark evidence (especially issue #376 pipeline vs monolithic) supports a **monolithic default** for routine implementation. A large per-concern rule catalog increased context cost without improving ROI on Class A/B tasks. The slim catalog adopted by this historical amendment is pinned at [`.context/rules/README.md`](https://github.com/mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template/blob/b21f76149c84962566950d61eeca7d54fcaeb505/.context/rules/README.md); the catalog was later retired from `main`.

**Decision:**

- **Remove** these normative rule files from `.context/rules/` (restore point: `origin/backup-2026-06-15`):
  - `agent_ownership.md`
  - `process_gates.md`
  - `process_model_tier.md`
  - `process_pr_completion.md`
  - `process_role_selection.md`
  - `process_subagent_bootstrap.md`
  - `process_template_detection.md`
- **Retain** durable surfaces for the same concerns outside the rule catalog:
  - Descriptive onboarding lifecycle (`ai-repo-template`, `template-seed`, `complete`) → the OpenCode `repo-onboarding` skill
  - Gates and PR completion → `AGENTS.md`, [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](../../.github/pull_request_template.md), and `scripts/verify-pr.sh`
  - Ownership / parallelism → `agent-parallelism-report.yml` remains; live ownership table enforcement is **deferred** until a future benchmark or operational need justifies restoring `agent_ownership.md`
- **Stage 1E context packs** on `main` drop references to removed rule files so harness manifests match the production catalog.

**Reversal:** If a future benchmark score set (documented in [`docs/benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md`](../benchmarks/agent-roi-benchmark-results.md) with a new `score_set_id`) shows favorable ROI for multi-role pipeline or full-rule injection as the default, **amend this ADR** with the contradicting evidence and restore removed rule files from `origin/backup-2026-06-15` (or a successor backup) as needed. Until then, monolithic default + slim catalog stand.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Keep benchmark guidance only in `.context/benchmarks/` (status quo)

- **Pros:** No ADR maintenance; protocol stays near harness.
- **Cons:** Policy recommendations invisible to ADR index; agents cite issue comments inconsistently; no revisit trigger.

### Option 2: Encode procedure + recommendations in ADR-031 (chosen)

- **Pros:** Durable policy index entry; links protocol to ADR-019/030; explicit Class C gap and revisit rules.
- **Cons:** Must update when new stages land; risk of drift from results file if not synced.

### Option 3: Amend ADR-019 in place with all benchmark conclusions

- **Pros:** Single model-policy ADR.
- **Cons:** ADR-019 already large; benchmark **procedure** is orthogonal to tier table; violates "new decision → new ADR" discipline for expanded scope.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single place to answer "how do we benchmark?" and "what did we learn?"
- Clear default: monolithic implementation unless coordination is the goal.
- One active review lifecycle replaces unused role and formal-review surfaces.
- Explicit Class C gap prevents over-generalizing from premerge Class A/B tasks.

### Negative

- Recommendations age; owners must update ADR or supersede when re-benchmarking.
- Stage 1E pack guidance remains benchmark-scoped until a separate production context-loading ADR lands.
- Optional advisory feedback can complete after implementation advances; some
  defects will instead be found by recurring post-merge review.

### Neutral

- Does not replace per-workflow env vars or ADR-019 tier table.
- Subjective JSON fixtures remain on `benchmark/roi` tag/branch per runbook — not on `main`.

## Implementation

- [x] Phase A harness + results originally landed on `main` (PR #379); issue
  #483 later isolated apparatus on `benchmark/roi` and results under `docs/`.
- [x] Canonical regrades for Stage 1, 1C, 1D, pipeline, 1E CP-1 documented in results file.
- [ ] Class C greenfield benchmark (`06-implement-class-c-framework-benchmark.md` on `benchmark/roi`).
- [ ] Stage 1E CP-2 robustness (deferred).
- [ ] Refresh Stage 1E policy against current `AGENTS.md` before a production context-pack routing change.
- [x] Slim `.context/rules/` catalog per Amendment 2026-06-15 (issue #437 / PR #438).
- [x] Apply the monolithic implementation and review lifecycle (issue #474 / PR #476).
- [x] Add risk-based problem framing and actionable critical review (issue #488 / PR #487).
- [ ] Refresh the model shortlist when Copilot pins are remapped.
- [ ] Record issue #480 sandbox OpenCode-versus-Cursor telemetry before retiring rollback providers.
