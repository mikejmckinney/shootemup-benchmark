# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> **Purpose**: Durable record of "why we chose X over Y." Every nontrivial
> architectural or process decision lives here. Code is the *what*; ADRs
> are the *why*.
>
> ADRs are *prospective* ("we will do X because we expect Y").
> *Retrospective* lessons ("we did X, and Z happened") live in
> [`docs/postmortems/`](../postmortems/README.md). A postmortem may
> trigger a new ADR (or supersede one), but the two artifacts are kept
> separate so the audit trail stays honest.

When you add a new ADR, add a row above and update its status if it later
changes.

## When to write a new ADR

See `adr-template.md` → "When to write a new ADR" for the canonical trigger
list. Normally, a changed decision needs a new ADR. A dated amendment to the
owning ADR is also permitted when the maintainer explicitly requests it and the
original rationale remains intact.

## Supersession discipline

When ADR-NNN replaces ADR-XXX, both files must be updated in the **same PR**:

1. **New ADR (`adr-NNN-...md`)**:
   - `Status: Accepted` (or `Proposed` if not yet ratified).
   - Body includes `Supersedes ADR-XXX` (or `Supersedes ADR-XXX in part`
     for partial supersession) in Context or References.
2. **Old ADR (`adr-XXX-...md`)**:
   - `Status: Superseded by ADR-NNN` (full supersession) **or**
     `Status: Accepted (superseded in part by ADR-NNN)` (partial
     supersession — use when only some sections/triggers/scope are
     replaced and the rest of the original decision still stands).
     Replaces the previous status line.
   - Body is left otherwise intact — preserve the original rationale; the
     new ADR explains what changed.
3. **This README** — flip the old ADR's status column to `Superseded by
   ADR-NNN` (or `Superseded in part by ADR-NNN`) and add a row for the
   new one.
4. **Deprecation without replacement**: set the old ADR's `Status:
   Deprecated` and explain in the body. No new ADR required.

Reviewers enforce status synchronization during ADR changes. Repository check
`scripts/checks/030-docs-structure.sh` verifies only that every indexed ADR
exists and every ADR file is indexed; it does not compare status text.

## What a well-documented ADR looks like

Use **ADR-007** ([adr-007-auto-resolve-review-threads.md](./adr-007-auto-resolve-review-threads.md))
as the model:

- **Status + Date** at the top (sortable, searchable).
- **Context** that describes the problem in the team's own words, not abstract
  framing. Cite the issue number tracking the gap.
- **Decision** stated plainly and actionably. No marketing language.
- **Options Considered** — at least 2–3, each with honest pros/cons.
  Include the "do nothing" option when it's plausible.
- **Consequences** split into Positive / Negative / Neutral. Negative
  consequences are the most valuable section; if it's empty, you didn't
  think hard enough.
- **Known limitations** documented inline when the decision ships with a
  gap, with a cross-reference to the tracking issue (ADR-007 cites #100
  for its Copilot-path FORBIDDEN limitation).
- **Verification block** with named verification phases (V1, V2, …) and
  evidence links to the PRs/comments where each was validated.
- **Implementation checklist** with PR references — the audit trail for
  what shipped together.
- **References** to related ADRs, issues, and external docs.

If your ADR is missing one of these sections, ask whether the section is
genuinely N/A or whether you skipped the work. The Negative Consequences
and Verification blocks in particular tend to get skipped under pressure
and tend to be exactly where the actual lessons live.

## Numbering

Sequential, zero-padded: `adr-001`, `adr-002`, … `adr-099`, `adr-100`.
Don't renumber when superseding — keep the original number; supersession
is a status, not a renumber.

**Sandbox-prefixed numbering.** ADRs that are scoped to the sandbox
sibling repo (`mikejmckinney/ai-repo-template-sandbox`) and not yet
intended for upstream use the parallel sequence `adr-sandbox-NNN`
(`adr-sandbox-001`, `adr-sandbox-002`, …). They share this directory
and this README's table for discoverability but are sorted at the
bottom of the table under their own subsection so the sequential
upstream `adr-NNN` numbering remains visually contiguous. On
forward-port to upstream, a sandbox-prefixed ADR is **renumbered** to
the next available upstream `adr-NNN` slot (the supersession-keeps-its-
number rule above does not apply because the sandbox prefix is a scope
marker, not a sequence marker). Any references to the old sandbox
number (status footnotes on related ADRs, prose mentions in guides) are
rewritten in the same forward-port PR — there should be no `adr-sandbox-NNN`
strings left in the upstream repo after the port.
