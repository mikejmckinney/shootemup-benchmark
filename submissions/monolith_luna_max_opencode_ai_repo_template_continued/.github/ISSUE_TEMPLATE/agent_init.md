## Repository Initialization Task

This repository was created from the `ai-repo-template`. Please initialize it for the actual project.

## User outcome (15-minute test)

<!--
Optional but recommended. If you can answer this clearly here, add the
`outcome-validated` label to record that the user outcome is explicit.

The test: "If a user spent 15 minutes with the initialized repo, what
would they be able to DO?" Focus on user actions (run, build, deploy,
onboard), not files created.
-->

## Truth Hierarchy

Use this priority order when information conflicts:
1. Current assigned issue and linked PR
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `./.context/**`
4. `./docs/**`
5. Codebase

## Preflight Checks

- [ ] Verify `.context/00_INDEX.md` exists
- [ ] Verify the OpenCode `repo-onboarding` skill is available
- [ ] Inspect `.context/onboarding-state.json` and run the onboarding classifier
- [ ] Run `git remote -v` to detect repository owner/name

## Initialization Steps

### 1. Understand the Project

Determine the project purpose and current status from:
- `.context/**`
- `docs/**`
- Existing codebase (if any)

### 2. Run Repository Onboarding

Execute the OpenCode `repo-onboarding` skill and follow its classified mode.
Make evidence-backed onboarding edits only when the classifier returns
`template-seed`; `ai-repo-template` and `complete` require orientation only.

### 3. Update README.md

- Preserve useful README structure and revise only where project evidence requires it

Include:
- Project name and description
- Setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Tech stack
- `## Limitations` — known constraints of the project
- `## Future Improvements` — forward-looking items not on the active roadmap
- `## FAQ` — short section or link to `docs/FAQ.md`

### 4. Customize docs/FAQ.md

- Preserve useful template entries and revise only those contradicted by project evidence
- Add project-specific questions surfaced during onboarding
- If the project will keep the FAQ in README instead, delete `docs/FAQ.md`

### 5. Regenerate AI_REPO_GUIDE.md

Create a new AI_REPO_GUIDE.md for THIS repo (not the template), including:
- Project summary
- Where canonical truth lives (`.context/00_INDEX.md`)
- How to use the context pack
- Repo conventions
- Build/test/lint commands
- Next steps

### 6. Verify Repository Checks

Update `.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml`:
- Preserve the repository checks already in use
- Add project-specific build, lint, typecheck, and test commands only when the
  detected stack defines them

### 7. Fill in Context Pack

Update `.context/` files:
- `00_INDEX.md` — project summary and key decisions
- `roadmap.md` — shipped milestones and issue-backed future work
- `state/agent_state_comment_template.md` — copy into issues/PRs for live agent state when work begins
- For verified UI work only, generate root `DESIGN.md` with the onboarding
  helper and replace bracketed prompts from product evidence

### 8. Configure Secrets (if needed)

Document any required repository secrets:
- API keys, database URLs, etc.

## Important Notes

- Do not broadly reset `.context/**`; modify only evidence-backed project state
- Propose changes via comments if you see issues
- Run `./test.sh` to verify template integrity after changes

## Implementation Plan

### Outcome

### Approach

### Files to change

- [`README.md`](../blob/main/README.md) — <one phrase: what change>
- [`scripts/tests/`](../tree/main/scripts/tests) — <one phrase: what change>

<!-- Replace the examples with every expected file or directory. Existing files
and directories must be clickable: use ../blob/main/<path> for a file and
../tree/main/<path> for a directory. For a planned new path, link its nearest
existing parent and label the new path in the description. For a glob, link its
containing directory and keep the glob in the link text or description. -->

### Keyed-state semantics (conditional)

Complete this matrix when work appends, merges, upserts, replaces, migrates,
deduplicates, or otherwise persists records by key. Otherwise state `Not
applicable — no persisted keyed state`.

- **first write:**
- **identical retry:**
- **changed retry:**
- **unrelated-key preservation:**
- **duplicate legacy records:**
- **missing-field compatibility:**

### Delivery boundaries

Identify independently shippable and revertible workstreams. For each
workstream, state its dependencies, shared contracts, and rollback effect.
Recommend one PR, stacked PRs, or separate PRs. If independently revertible
work remains combined, state the load-bearing reason, such as atomic rollout, a
shared contract, lower total process cost, or an explicit maintainer decision.
This is a recommendation, not an automatic split rule.

### User outcome validation plan — PRIMARY

For each material claim, plan one auditable record:

```text
Material claim:
Environment:
Why representative:
Implementation SHA:
Action performed:
Expected result:
Observed result:
Artifact:
Artifact type:
Redaction:
Retention:
Evidence reuse: <none, or Paths: <later path analysis>; Conditions: <load-bearing condition analysis>>
Result: pass | fail | blocked
```

Choose the most representative practical environment; cost and speed may
distinguish equally representative options but cannot replace the affected
user's action or required result. Paid or destructive actions require explicit
approval and remain blocked until performed. Mixed changes may require more
than one record. External-state and runtime claims cannot be prose-only.
See `docs/guides/outcome-validation.md`.

### Supporting verification

**Change class**: <code-or-docs | pull_request-triggered workflow | default-branch-only workflow | mixed>
**Verification evidence contract**: 1
**Default-branch constrained**: <yes | no>
**Verification target**: <PR branch | preview | dogfood | sandbox repo | both>

The classifier owns workflow-trigger facts. For mixed changes, separately state
whether the changed behavior depends on default-branch execution. Select outcome
environments from the user journey; use the sibling sandbox adapter only when
GitHub default-branch state is load-bearing.
