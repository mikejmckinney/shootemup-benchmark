# diag-hang-snapshot.sh — capture a rolling snapshot of system + Copilot
# Chat session state into /tmp/hang-diag/ so the next session hang can be
# diagnosed after-the-fact instead of guessed at.
#
# Target environment: dev-container Linux (GitHub Codespaces / VS Code
# Remote Containers). The hangs this script diagnoses occur in the
# Copilot Chat extension running inside the container; the diagnostic
# tools below (free, top -w, ps --sort, ss) are Linux-specific by
# design. macOS portability is not in scope for v1 — diagnosing macOS
# hangs would use vm_stat / Activity Monitor / equivalent and is a
# separate workflow. (PR #297 Round 9 ISS-55, declined out-of-scope.)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/diag-hang-snapshot.sh &           # run in background
#   echo "started, pid=$!"
#   # ... trigger the workload that hangs ...
#   # when it hangs (or after), inspect /tmp/hang-diag/
#
# Stop with: kill <pid>  (or it self-terminates after MAX_SAMPLES).
#
# What it captures every INTERVAL seconds:
#   - top -b -n1 (CPU/RSS per process)
#   - ss -tnp ESTABLISHED (open TCP, esp. *.githubcopilot.com)
#   - ps -eo pid,ppid,pcpu,pmem,rss,etime,cmd (focused on node/code/gh)
#   - free -h
#   - tail of $VSCODE_TARGET_SESSION_LOG if present
#
# Failure mode: `set -uo pipefail` deliberately omits `-e`. A diagnostic
# sampler should keep capturing what it can even when one command fails
# (e.g. `ss` blocked by permissions, or `top` formatting flag absent on a
# stripped image). With `-e`, a single transient failure inside the per-
# sample block would abort the whole sampling loop and lose the rest of
# the snapshot — defeating the script's purpose. (PR #297 Round 9
# ISS-53, declined-with-rationale.)

# Diagnostic samples may include command-line args and session-log tails.
# Restrict /tmp/hang-diag artifacts to the current user (R14 ISS-72).
