# scripts/verify-pr.sh — classify a PR's changed paths and compare against
# the declared `Change class` from the issue Implementation Plan comment.
#
# Why this exists (issue #227): workflows triggered by `pull_request_review`,
# `issue_comment`, `push`, `schedule`, and `workflow_run` always run from
# the **default branch**, never the PR branch. PR #225 paid 11 rounds of
# bot review for one such change because the bug class is structurally
# unverifiable on the PR branch. This script is the surgical Plan-template
# guard: if you declare `code-or-docs` but you actually touched a
# default-branch-only workflow, select the outcome environment using
# `docs/guides/outcome-validation.md` and run the sibling repository adapter
# in `docs/guides/sandbox-verification.md`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-pr.sh [--base <ref>] [--declared <class>] [--paths-from <file>]
#
# Resolution order for the changed-path list (first hit wins):
#   1. --paths-from FILE  (one path per line; `-` for stdin)
#   2. PR_FILES env var   (newline-separated; set by CI from the PR API)
#   3. git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD  (base default: origin/main)
#
# Resolution order for the declared class (first hit wins):
#   1. --declared <class>
#   2. PR_DECLARED_CLASS env var
#   3. (none) — script reports the *detected* class only and exits 0;
#      this lets developers run it locally for an at-a-glance check.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — no declaration provided, OR declaration matches detection.
#   1  — declaration mismatch (detected class is more restrictive than
#        declared, or pure type mismatch).
#   2  — usage / argument error.
#
# Detection below is the canonical workflow-verifiability contract.
# docs/guides/agent-pipeline.md describes the resulting classes and points here.

verify-pr.sh — Plan-template Change-class classifier (issue #227)

Usage:
  scripts/verify-pr.sh [options]

Options:
  --base <ref>          Base ref for `git diff` (default: origin/main).
  --declared <class>    Declared Change class. One of:
                          code-or-docs
                          pull_request-triggered workflow
                          default-branch-only workflow
                          mixed
  --paths-from <file>   Read changed paths from FILE (one per line).
                        Use `-` for stdin.
  --quiet               Suppress the per-path detection trace.
  -h, --help            Show this help.

Exit codes:
  0  match (or no --declared given)
  1  mismatch
  2  usage error

# ── Classify each path ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Detection rules:
#
# default-branch-only workflow
#   Any `.github/workflows/<name>.yml` whose triggers include any of:
#   pull_request_review, pull_request_review_comment, issue_comment,
#   push, schedule, workflow_run. These always execute from the
#   default branch, so a PR-branch change to such a file cannot be
#   exercised pre-merge.
#
# pull_request-triggered workflow
#   Any `.github/workflows/<name>.yml` that includes pull_request and has
#   no default-only trigger. Optional workflow_dispatch does not change
#   that classification. Dispatch-only workflows are loaded from the
#   default branch and therefore belong to the default-only bucket.
#
# code-or-docs
#   Anything else: source, docs, scripts, config, ADRs, role files, etc.
#
# A diff that contains paths from more than one bucket above classifies
# as `mixed`. That structural fact does not decide whether the changed behavior
# requires default-branch execution; the versioned evidence validator owns that
# separate declaration.

has_default_only=0
has_pr_triggered=0

# Triggers that pin a workflow to default-branch execution.
#
# Note on `pull_request_target`: per GitHub docs, this trigger runs in
# the context of the PR's *base* branch (the target / default branch),
# not the PR head. The workflow file is therefore loaded from the
# default branch ref, exactly like push / schedule / workflow_run.
# Treating it as PR-branch verifiable would be wrong, and it's also
# the trigger most often abused for write-permission escalation, so
# being conservative here is the right default.
