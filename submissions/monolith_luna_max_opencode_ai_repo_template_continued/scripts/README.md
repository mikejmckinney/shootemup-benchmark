## Usage Guidelines

### For Agents

Before marking a task complete, run verification:
```bash
./scripts/verify-env.sh
```

### For Developers

After adapting a new project, run its explicit project setup:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This command is intentionally not part of the Dev Container lifecycle because
it can install project dependencies, run a build, and configure repository
labels and secret checks. Codespaces environment creation uses
`codespace-post-create.sh` instead.

Codespaces tool bootstrap installs core plus agent tools by default. It can be
checked without mutation:

```bash
./scripts/install-codespace-tools.sh --profile default --verify-only
```

The pinned `uv` archive provides both `uv` and `uvx`. The lightweight
`verification` profile installs that runtime plus pinned Bats and the
apt-managed verification prerequisites without installing browser or agent
tools.

Use `--profile core` for only the quality/runtime prerequisites. The explicit
agent profile preserves the same core-plus-agent union as the default:

```bash
./scripts/install-codespace-tools.sh --profile agents
```

The core profile installs Open Design Studio and its full generic catalogs.
Run `./scripts/install-media-tools.sh` once to install the separate `media`
profile (FFmpeg) and provision the pinned HyperFrames browser. The renderer
wrapper disables mutable global skill installation; its eight committed skill
packages remain governed by `skills-lock.json`.

Preview package and build caches when a Codespace approaches its storage limit:

```bash
./scripts/cleanup-codespace-caches.sh
```

The preview does not modify files. Use `--apply` to clean npm content and npx,
Bun, uv, pip, and Go caches. Cleanup skips uv while a uv process is active and
never removes agent databases, history, credentials, installed tools, or editor
extensions. The next package or tool invocation may require network access and
take longer while its cache is rebuilt.

Preview the expiration of the local OpenCode OpenAI OAuth credential:

```bash
./scripts/sync-opencode-oauth-secret.sh
```

Pass `--apply` to update `OPENCODE_OPENAI_AUTH` in the current repository. The
uploaded JSON contains the current access token, expiration, and account ID, but
replaces the real refresh token with `ci-refresh-disabled`. Output includes only
repository and expiration metadata. Expired access is rejected before upload.
In Codespaces, start and attach lifecycle hooks attempt this update automatically
after PAT setup only for a repository verified as private. Lifecycle retries use
a repository-scoped SHA-256 fingerprint under the user state directory to avoid
rewriting an unchanged bundle. The fingerprint is written only after a successful
upload; failures remain non-fatal and retry on the next attach. Explicit `--apply`
forces an update, while lifecycle calls add `--if-changed`. Actions receives no
refresh token, and stale credentials automatically omit Sol.

Generate and provision the separate Claude Code subscription token annually:

```bash
claude setup-token
gh secret set CLAUDE_OAUTH_SECRET --repo OWNER/REPO
```

The first command prints but does not save the one-year token. Copy it into the
hidden prompt from the second command, or use the repository's Actions secret
settings. Do not place the token in shell history or copy refresh-enabled Claude
login credentials.

## Creating New Scripts

1. Create the script in this directory
2. Add a shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh`
4. Add error handling: `set -e` (exit on error)
5. Document it in this README
6. Add to `test.sh` verification if critical

## Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: What this script does
# Usage: ./scripts/script-name.sh [args]

set -e  # Exit on error

# Colors for output
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
NC='\033[0m'

log_info() { printf "${GREEN}[INFO]${NC} %s\n" "$1"; }
log_warn() { printf "${YELLOW}[WARN]${NC} %s\n" "$1"; }
log_error() { printf "${RED}[ERROR]${NC} %s\n" "$1"; }

# Your script logic here

log_info "Done!"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Idempotent**: Scripts should be safe to run multiple times
2. **Verbose**: Output what's happening for debugging
3. **Fail Fast**: Use `set -e` to stop on first error
4. **Check Dependencies**: Verify required tools exist before running
5. **Document**: Add usage comments at the top of each script
