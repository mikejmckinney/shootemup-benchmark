# Context Pack Index

> **Purpose**: This is the entry point for AI agents to understand Neon Barrage's direction, constraints, and current state.

## How to Use This Directory

The `.context/` directory is the project's canonical process and planning layer.
Inherited template process guidance remains under `docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, and
`.github/`; this directory records the product-specific evidence for Neon Barrage.

### Priority order (when conflicts arise)

See `AGENTS.md` §"Truth hierarchy" for the canonical definition. Summary:
current issue/PR > `AGENTS.md` > `.context/**` > `docs/**` > codebase.

## Quick Start for Agents (Lazy Load Pattern)

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, then this file.
2. Read the assigned GitHub issue body and linked PR when a durable task exists.
3. Use one monolithic implementing agent; use local consensus only when justified.
4. Treat `state/` as the GitHub-first live-state reference surface.
5. Read `roadmap.md`, vision files, or dated session archives only when their
   domain intersects the task or a specific historical investigation.
6. For benchmark work, use `docs/guides/model-roi-benchmark-runbook.md` and
   published evidence under `docs/benchmarks/`.

**Execution model**: one implementing agent, blocking CI, normal parallel
advisory review, recurring retro, and opt-in local consensus. See ADR-031.

## Project Summary

**Project Name**: `Neon Barrage`

**Description**: A browser-based 2D arcade shoot-'em-up with keyboard and touch
controls, generated sound, responsive presentation, and a persistent Supabase
top-ten leaderboard hosted from Cloudflare static assets.

**Program status**: Application implementation, Supabase migration, Cloudflare
deployment, and production verification are complete. The factual handoff is in
`benchmark-result.json`.

**Primary Stack**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Node's built-in test runner and
static build script, Cloudflare Workers Static Assets, and Supabase REST with a
public client key.

**What this repo currently ships**:

- The benchmark brief in `BENCHMARK_TASK.md`.
- The implemented game in `index.html` and `src/`.
- The checked-in Supabase migration under `supabase/migrations/`.
- The production handoff in `benchmark-result.json`.
- Inherited AI collaboration, validation, and Codespaces tooling.
- Product-specific context and roadmap under `.context/`.

## Product References

- [BENCHMARK_TASK.md](../BENCHMARK_TASK.md) defines the required user outcome
  and fixed deployment constraints.
- [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) is the root UI and accessibility contract.
- `AGENTS.md` remains the authoritative operating contract.

## Current Task

`BENCHMARK_TASK.md` is the delivery contract for Neon Barrage. The game,
persistence, deployment, and live verification artifacts are complete; future
work should preserve the public selectors, adapter, and security boundary.

## Inherited Governance Decisions

For the full ADR index, see [docs/decisions/README.md](../docs/decisions/README.md). The rows below call out the inherited decisions that shape repository operation.
